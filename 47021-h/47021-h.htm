<h2 class="eee">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Having in my &ldquo;Story of the Stars&rdquo; told of
far distant suns, many of them probably with
planets revolving around them, I have in the
present volume, which is a companion to the
former one, to treat of the Sun in particular&mdash;our
Sun as we may call him&mdash;and the body of attendants
which own his sway by revolving round him.
The attendants are the planets, commonly so
called, together with a certain number of comets.
I shall deal with all these objects rather from a
descriptive and practical than from a speculative
or essay point of view, and with special reference
to the convenience and opportunities of persons
possessing, or having access to, what may be
called popular telescopes&mdash;telescopes say of from
two to four inches of aperture, and costing any
sum between &pound;10 and &pound;50. There is much
pleasure and profit to be got out of telescopes of
this type, always presuming that they are used by
persons possessed of patience and perseverance.
It is a very great mistake, though an extremely
common one, to suppose that unless a man can
command a big telescope he can do no useful
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
work, and derive no pleasure from his work. To
all such croakers I always point as a moral the
achievements of Hermann Goldschmidt, who from
an attic window at Fontenay-aux-Roses near
Paris, with a telescope of only 2&frac12; inches aperture,
discovered no fewer than 14 minor planets.</p>
<p>As this volume is intended for general reading,
rather than for educational or technical purposes,
I have kept statistical details and numerical
expressions within very narrow limits, mere
figures being always more or less unattractive.</p>
<p>John Richard Green, in the Preface to his
book on <i>The Making of England</i>, writes as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;I
may add, in explanation of the reappearance
of a few passages ... which my
readers may have seen before, that where I had
little or nothing to add or to change, I have preferred
to insert a passage from previous work,
with the requisite connections and references, to
the affectation of rewriting such a passage for the
mere sake of giving it an air of novelty.&rdquo; I will
venture to adopt this thought as my own, and to
apply it to the repetition, here and there, of ideas
and phrases which are already to be found in my
<i>Handbook of Astronomy</i>.</p>

<h1 title="">THE
<br />STORY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.</span></h2>
<p>By the term &ldquo;Solar System&rdquo; it is to be understood
that an Astronomer, speaking from the
standpoint of an inhabitant of the Earth, wishes
to refer to that object, the Sun, which is to him
the material and visible centre of life and heat
and control, and also to those bodies dependent
on the Sun which circulate round it at various
distances, deriving their light and heat from the
Sun, and known as planets and comets. The
statement just made may be regarded as a general
truth, but as the strictest accuracy on scientific
matters is of the utmost importance, a trivial
reservation must perhaps be put upon the foregoing
broad assertion. There is some reason for
thinking that possibly one of the planets (Jupiter)
possesses a little inherent light of its own which
is not borrowed from the Sun; whilst of the
comets it must certainly be said that, as a rule,
they shine with intrinsic, not borrowed light. Respecting
these reservations more hereafter.</p>
<p>The planets are divided into &ldquo;primary&rdquo; and
&ldquo;secondary.&rdquo; By a &ldquo;primary&rdquo; planet we mean
one which directly circulates round the Sun; by
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
a &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; planet we mean one which in the
first instance circulates round a primary planet,
and therefore only in a secondary sense circulates
round the Sun. The planets are also &ldquo;major&rdquo;
or &ldquo;minor&rdquo;; this, however, is only a distinction
of size.</p>
<p>The secondary planets are usually termed
&ldquo;satellites,&rdquo; or, very often, in popular language,
&ldquo;moons,&rdquo; because they own allegiance to their
respective primaries just as our Moon&mdash;<i>the</i> Moon&mdash;does
to the Earth. But the use of the term
&ldquo;moon&rdquo; is inconvenient, and it is better to stick
to &ldquo;satellite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is yet another method of classifying the
planets which has its advantages. They are sometimes
divided into &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; and &ldquo;superior.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; planets are those which travel
round the Sun in orbits which are inside the
Earth&rsquo;s orbit; the &ldquo;superior&rdquo; planets are those
whose orbits are outside the Earth.</p>
<p>The following is an enumeration of the major
planets in the order of their distances, reckoning
from the Sun outwards:&mdash;</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Mercury.</dt>
<dt>2. Venus.</dt>
<dt>3. The Earth.</dt>
<dt>4. Mars.</dt>
<dt>5. Jupiter.</dt>
<dt>6. Saturn.</dt>
<dt>7. Uranus.</dt>
<dt>8. Neptune.</dt></dl>
<p>All the above are major planets and also primary
planets. In between Nos. 4 and 5 circulate the
&ldquo;Minor&rdquo; planets, an ever-increasing body, now
more than 400 in number, but all, except one or
perhaps two, invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Inferior&rdquo;
planets it will be
seen from the
above table comprise
Mercury and
Venus, whilst the
&ldquo;Superior&rdquo; planets
are Mars and all
those beyond.</p>
<p>Great differences
exist in the
inclinations of the
orbits of the different
planets to the
plane of the ecliptic,
a fact which is
better shown by a
diagram than by a
table of mere figures.
The orbit of
Uranus is indeed
so much inclined
that its motion is
really <i>retrograde</i>
compared with the
general run of the
planets: and the
same remark applies,
though much
more forcibly, to
the case of Neptune.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Inclination of Planetary Orbits.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The actual
movements of the
planets round the
Sun are extremely
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
simple, for they do nought else but go on, and on,
and on, incessantly, always in the same direction,
and almost, though not quite, at a uniform pace,
though in orbits very variously inclined to the
plane of the ecliptic. But an element of extreme
complication is introduced into their apparent
movements by reason of the fact that we are
obliged to study the planets from one of their own
number, which is itself always in motion.</p>
<p>If the Earth itself were a fixture, the study of
the movements of the planets would be a comparatively
easy matter, whilst to an observer on
the Sun it would be a supremely easy matter.</p>
<p>Greatly as the planets differ among themselves
in their sizes, distances from the Sun, and physical
peculiarities, they have certain things in common,
and it will be well to make this matter clear before
we go into more recondite topics. For instance,
not only do they move incessantly round
the Sun in the same direction at a nearly uniform
pace, but the planes of their orbits are very little
inclined to the common plane of reference, the
ecliptic, or to one another.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
The direction of
motion of the planets as viewed from the north
side of the ecliptic is contrary to the motion of
the hands of a watch. Their orbits, unlike the
orbits of comets, are nearly circular, that is, they
are only very slightly oval. Agreeably to the
principles of what is known as the Law of Universal
Gravitation, the speed with which they
move in their orbits is greatest in those parts
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
which lie nearest the Sun, and least in those parts
which are most remote from the Sun; in other
words, they move quickest in Perihelion and
slowest in Aphelion.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig3">

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Comparative Sizes of the Major Planets.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The physical peculiarities which the planets
have in common include the following points:&mdash;they
are opaque bodies, and shine by reflecting
light which they receive from the Sun. Probably
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
all of them are endued with an axial rotation,
hence their inhabitants, if there are any, have the
alternation of day and night, like the inhabitants
of the Earth, but the duration of their days,
measured in absolute terrestrial hours, will in
most cases differ materially from the days and
nights with which we are familiar.</p>
<p>I stated on a previous page that, owing to the
circumstances in which we find ourselves on the
Earth, the apparent and real movements of the
planets are widely different. It would be beyond
the scope of this little work to go into these
differences in any considerable detail; suffice it
then to indicate only a few general points. In
the first place, an important distinction exists between
the visible movements of the inferior and
superior planets. The inferior planets, Mercury
and Venus, lying as they do within the orbit of
the Earth, are much restricted in their movements,
in the sky. We can never see them except when
they are more or less near to the rising (or risen)
or setting (or set) Sun. The extreme angular
distance from the Sun in the sky to which Mercury
can attain is but 27&deg;, and therefore we can
never observe it otherwise than in sunlight or
twilight, for it never rises more than 1&frac12; hours
before sunrise nor sets later than 1&frac12; hours after
sunset. Of course between these limits the planet
is above the horizon all the time that the Sun is
above the horizon, but except in very large telescopes
is not usually to be detected during the
day-time. These remarks regarding Mercury
apply likewise in principle to Venus; only the
orbit of Venus being larger than the orbit of
Mercury, and Venus itself being larger in size
than Mercury, the application of these principles
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
leads to somewhat different results. The greatest
possible distance of Venus may be 47&deg; instead of
Mercury&rsquo;s 27&deg;. Venus is therefore somewhat
more emancipated from the effects of twilight.
The body of Venus being also very much larger
and brighter than the body of Mercury, it may be
more often and more easily detected in broad daylight.</p>
<p>It follows from the foregoing statement that
the inferior planets can never be seen in those
regions of the heavens which are, as it is technically
called, in &ldquo;Opposition&rdquo; to the Sun; that is,
which are on the meridian at midnight whilst the
Sun is on the meridian in its midday splendour to
places on the opposite side of the Earth. On the
other hand, the two inferior planets on stated,
though rare, occasions exhibit to a terrestrial
spectator certain phenomena of great interest and
importance in which no superior planet can ever
take part. I am here referring to the &ldquo;Transits&rdquo;
of Mercury and Venus across the Sun. If these
planets and the Earth all revolved round the Sun
exactly in the plane of the ecliptic, transits of
these planets would be perpetually recurring after
even intervals of only a few months; but the fact
that the orbit of Mercury is inclined 7&deg;, and that
of Venus about 3&frac12;, to the ecliptic, involves such
complications that transits of Mercury only occur
at unequal intervals of several years, whilst, in
extreme cases, more than a century may elapse
between two successive transits of Venus. For a
transit of an inferior planet over the Sun to take
place, the Earth and the planet and the Sun must
be exactly in the same straight line, reckoned both
vertically and horizontally. Twice in every revolution
round the Sun an inferior planet is vertically
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
in the same straight line with the Earth and
the Sun; and it is said to be in &ldquo;inferior conjunction&rdquo;
when the planet comes between the Earth
and the Sun; and in &ldquo;superior conjunction&rdquo; when
the planet is on the further side of the Sun, the
Sun intervening between the Earth and the planet.
But for all three to be horizontally in the same
straight line is quite another matter. It is the
orbital inclinations of Mercury and Venus which
enable them, so to speak, to dodge an observer
who is on the lookout to see them pass exactly in
front of the Sun, or to disappear behind the Sun;
and so it comes about that a favourable combination
of circumstances which is rare is needed before
either of the aforesaid planets can be seen
as round black spots passing in front of the Sun.
A passage of either of these planets behind the
Sun could never be seen by human eye, because
of the overpowering brilliancy of the Sun&rsquo;s rays,
even though an Astronomer might know by his
calculations the exact moment that the planet
was going to pass behind the Sun.</p>
<p>When an inferior planet attains its greatest
angular distance from the Sun, as we see it (which
I have already stated to be about 27&deg; in the case
of Mercury and 47&deg; in the case of Venus), such
planet is said to be at its &ldquo;greatest elongation,&rdquo;
&ldquo;east&rdquo; or &ldquo;west,&rdquo; as the case may be. At eastern
elongation or indeed whenever the planet is
east of the Sun, it is, to use a familiar phrase, an
&ldquo;evening star&rdquo;; on the other hand, at western
elongation, or whenever it is on the western side
of the Sun, it is known as a &ldquo;morning star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the movements of an inferior planet are followed
sufficiently long by the aid of a star map, it
will be seen that sometimes it appears to be proceeding
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
in a forward direction through the signs
of the zodiac; then for a while it will seem to
stand still; then at another time it will apparently
go backwards, or possess a retrograde motion.
All these peculiarities have their originating cause
in the motion of the Earth itself, for the absolute
movement of the planet never varies, being always
in the same direction, that is, forwards in the order
of the signs.</p>
<p>Turning now to the superior planets, we have
to face an altogether different succession of circumstances.
A superior planet is not, as it were,
chained to the Sun so as to be unable to escape
beyond the limits of morning or evening twilight;
it may have any angular distance from the Sun
up to 180&deg;, reaching which point it approaches
the Sun on the opposite side, step by step, until
it again comes into conjunction with the Sun.
As applied to a superior planet, the term &ldquo;conjunction&rdquo;
means the absolute moment when the
Earth and the Sun and the planet are in the same
straight line, the Sun being in the middle. In
such a case, to us on the Earth the planet is lost
in the Sun&rsquo;s rays, whilst to a spectator on the
planet the Earth would appear similarly lost in
the Sun&rsquo;s rays, as the Earth would be at that stage
of her orbit which we, speaking of <i>our</i> inferior
planets, call superior conjunction.</p>
<p>For a clear comprehension of all the various
matters which we have just been speaking of,
a careful study of diagrams of a geometrical
character, or better still, of models, would be
necessary.</p>
<p>Something must now be said about the phases
of the planets. Mercury and Venus, in regard to
their orbital motions, stand very much on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
same footing with respect to the inhabitants of
the Earth as the Moon does, and accordingly both
those planets in their periodical circuits round
the Sun exhibit the same succession of phases as
the Moon does. In the case, however, of the
superior planets things are otherwise. Two only
of them, Mars and Jupiter, are sufficiently near
the Earth to exhibit any phase at all. When they
are in quadrature (<i>i. e.</i>, 90&deg; from the Sun on either
side) there is a slight loss of light to be noticed
along one limb. In other words, the disc of each
ceases for a short time, and to a slight extent, to
be truly circular; it becomes what is known as
&ldquo;gibbous.&rdquo; This occasional feature of Mars may
be fairly conspicuous, or, at least, noticeable; but
in the case of Jupiter it will be less obvious unless
a telescope of some size is employed.</p>
<p>If the major planets are arbitrarily ranged in
two groups, Mercury, Venus, the Earth and Mars
being taken as an interior group, comparatively
near the Sun; whilst Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune are regarded as an exterior group, being
at a great distance from the Sun, it will be found
that some important physical differences exist
between the two groups.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/fig04.jpg" alt="Fig. 4.&mdash;Comparative size of the Sun as seen from the Planets named." width="500" height="337" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Comparative size of the Sun as seen from the Planets named.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Of the interior planets, the Earth and Mars
alone have satellites, and between them make up
a total of only three. The exterior planets, on
the other hand, all have satellites, the total number
being certainly seventeen, and possibly eighteen.
In detail, Jupiter has four, Saturn eight,
Uranus four, and Neptune one, and perhaps two.
These facts may be regarded as an instance of
the beneficence of the Creator of the Universe if
we consider that the satellites of these remoter
planets are so numerous, in order that by their
numbers they may do something to make up for
the small amount of light which, owing to their
distance from the Sun, their primaries receive.
Then again, the average density of the first group
of planets greatly exceeds the average density of
the second group in the approximate ratio of 5
to 1. Finally, there is reason to believe that
a marked difference exists in the axial rotations
of the planets forming the two groups. We do
not know the precise figures for all the exterior
planets, but the knowledge which we do possess
seems to imply that the average length of the day
in the case of the interior planets is about twenty-four
hours, but that in the case of the exterior
planets it is no more than about ten hours. These
figures can, however, only be presented as possibly
true, because observations on the rotation
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
periods of Mercury and Venus on the one hand,
and of Uranus and Neptune on the other, are attended
with so much difficulty that the recorded
results are of doubtful trustworthiness. It is,
however, reasonable to presume that the actual
size of the respective planets has more to do with
the matter than their distances from the Sun.</p>
<p>I think that the foregoing summary respecting
the planets collectively embraces as many points
as are likely to be of interest to the generality
of readers; we will therefore pass on to consider
somewhat in detail the several constituent members
of the solar system, beginning with the Sun.</p>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">THE SUN.</span></h2>
<p>There was once a book published, the title of
which was &ldquo;The Sun, Ruler, Fire, Light and Life
of the Planetary System.&rdquo; The title was by no
means a bad one, for without doubt the Sun may
fairly be said to represent practically all the ideas
conveyed by the designations quoted.</p>
<p>There is certainly no one body in creation
which is so emphatically pre-eminent as the Sun.
Whether or no there are stars which are suns&mdash;centres
of systems serving in their degree the
purposes served by our Sun, I need not now pause
to enquire, though I think the idea is a very
probable one; but of those celestial objects with
which our Earth has a direct relationship, beyond
doubt the Sun is unquestionably entitled to the
foremost place. It is, as it were, the pivot on
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
which the Earth and all the various bodies comprising
the Solar System revolve in their annual
progress. It is our source of light and heat, and
therefore may be called the great agent by which
an Almighty Providence wills to sustain animal
and vegetable life. The consideration of all the
complicated questions which arise out of these
functions of the Sun belongs to the domain of
Physics rather than that of Astronomy; still these
matters are of such momentous interest that an
allusion to them must be made, for they ought
not to be lost sight of by the student of Astronomy.
Half a century ago the actual state of
our knowledge respecting the Sun might without
difficulty be brought within the compass of a single
chapter in any book on Astronomy, but so enormous
has been the development of knowledge
respecting the Sun of late years, that it is no
longer a question of getting the materials properly
into one chapter, but it is a matter of a
whole volume being devoted to the Sun, or even,
as in the case of Secchi, of two large octavo volumes
of 500 pages each being required to cover
the whole ground exhaustively. The reader will
therefore easily understand that in the space at
my disposal in this little work nothing but a passing
glimpse can possibly be obtained of this great
subject. It is great not only in regard to the vast
array of purely astronomical facts which are at a
writer&rsquo;s command, but also on account of the extensive
ramifications which the subject has into
the domains of chemistry, photography, optics
and cognate sciences. I shall therefore endeavour
to limit myself generally to what an amateur can
see for himself with a small telescope, and can
readily understand, rather than attempt to say a
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
little something about everything, and fail in the
effort.</p>
<p>The mean distance of the Earth from the Sun
may be taken to be about 93 millions of miles,
and this distance is employed by Astronomers as
the unit by which most other long celestial distances
are reckoned. The true diameter of the
Sun is about 866,000 miles. The surface area exceeds
that of the Earth 11,946 times, and the volume
is 1,305,000 times greater. The mass or
weight of the Sun is 332,000 times that of the
Earth, or about 700 times that of all the planets
put together. Bulk for bulk the Sun is much
lighter than the Earth: whilst a cubic foot of the
Earth on an average weighs rather more than 5
times as much as a cubic foot of water, a cubic
foot of Sun is only about 3&frac12; times the weight of
the same bulk of water. This consideration of
the comparative lightness of the Sun (though in
his day the Sun was thought to be lighter than it
is now supposed to be) led Sir J. Herschel to infer
that an intense heat prevails in its interior,
independent it may be of its surface heat, so to
speak, of which alone we are directly cognizant
by the evidence of our senses.</p>
<p>The Sun is a sphere, and is surrounded by an
extensive but attenuated envelope, or rather series
of envelopes, which taken together bear some
analogy to the atmosphere surrounding the Earth.
These envelopes, which we shall have to consider
more in detail presently, throw out rays of light
and heat to the confines of the Solar System,
though as to the conditions and circumstances
under which that light and heat are generated we
are entirely ignorant. Of the potency of the
Sun&rsquo;s rays we can form but a feeble conception,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
for the amount received by the Earth is, it has
been calculated, but one 2300-millionth of the
whole. Our annual share would, it is supposed,
be sufficient to melt a layer of ice spread uniformly
over the Earth to a depth of 100 feet, or to
heat an ocean of fresh water 60 feet deep from
freezing point to boiling point. The illuminating
power of the Sun has to be expressed in language
of similar profundity. Thus it has been calculated
to equal that which would be afforded by
5563 wax candles concentrated at a distance of
one foot from the observer. Again, it has been
concluded that no fewer than half a million of
full moons shining all at once would be required
to make up a mass of light equal to that of the
Sun. I present all these conclusions to the reader
as they are furnished by various physicists who
have investigated such matters, but it is rather
uncertain as to how much reliance can safely be
placed on such calculations in detail.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Ordinary Sun-spot, June 22, 1885.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To an amateur possessed of a small telescope,
the Sun offers (when the weather is above the
English average of recent years) a very great
and constant variety of matters for studious scrutiny
in its so-called &ldquo;spots.&rdquo; To the naked eye,
or even on a hasty telescopic glance, the Sun
presents the appearance of a uniform disc of yellowish
white colour, though often a little attention
will soon result in the discovery of a few, or
it may be many, little black, or blackish patches,
scattered here and there over the disc seemingly
without order or method. We shall presently
find out, however, that this last-named suggestion
is wholly inaccurate. Though commonly called
&ldquo;spots,&rdquo; these dark appearances are not simple
spots, as the word might imply, for around the
rather black patch which constitutes generally
the main feature of the spot there is almost
invariably a fringe of paler tint; whilst within the confines of the
black patch which first catches the eye there is often a nucleus
or inner portion of far more intense depth of shade. The innermost and
darkest portion being termed the <i>nucleus</i>, the ordinary
black portion is known as <i>umbra</i>, whilst
the encompassing fringe is the <i>penumbra</i>. It
is not always the case that each individual umbra
has a penumbra all to itself, for several spots
are occasionally included in one common penumbra.
And it may further be remarked that
cases of an umbra without a penumbra and the
contrary are on record, though these may be
termed exceptional, often having relation to material
organic changes either just commencing or
just coming to a conclusion. A marked contrast
subsists in all cases between the luminosity of the
penumbra and that of the general surface of the
Sun contiguous. Towards its exterior edge the
penumbra is usually darker than at its inner edge,
where it comes in contact with the umbra. The
outline of the penumbra is usually very irregular,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
but the umbra, especially in the larger spots, is
often of regular form (comparatively speaking of
course) and the nucleus (or nuclei) of the umbra
still more noticeably partakes of a compactness
of outline.</p>
<p>Spots are for the most part confined to a zone
extending 35&deg; or so on each side of the solar
equator; and they are neither permanent in their
form nor stationary in their position. In their
want of permanence, they are subject, apparently,
to no definite laws, for they frequently appear
and disappear with great suddenness.</p>
<p>Their motions are evidently of a two-fold nature;
the Sun itself rotates on its axis, and the
spots collectively participate in this movement of
rotation; but over and above this it has been
conclusively proved that sometimes a spot has a
proper motion of translation of its own independently
of the motion which it has in consequence
of the Sun&rsquo;s axial rotation. Curiously enough,
spots are very rare immediately under the Sun&rsquo;s
equator. It is in the zone extending from 8&deg; to
20&deg; North or South, as the case may be, that they
are most abundant; or, to be more precise still,
their favourite latitude seems to be 17&deg; or 18&deg;.
They are often more numerous and of a greater
general size in the northern hemisphere, to which
it may be added that the zone between 11&deg; and
15&deg; North is particularly noted for large and
enduring spots. A gregarious tendency is often
very obvious, and where the groups are very
straggling an imaginary line joining the extreme
ends of the group will generally be found more
or less parallel to the solar equator; and not only
so, but extending a long way, or sometimes almost
entirely, across the whole of the visible disc.
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
With respect to the foregoing matters Sir John
Herschel remarked:&mdash;&ldquo;These circumstances ...
point evidently to physical peculiarities in certain
parts of the Sun&rsquo;s body more favourable than in
others to the production of the spots, on the one
hand; and on the other, to a general influence of
its rotation on its axis as a determining cause in
their distribution and arrangement, and would
appear indicative of a system of movements in
the fluids which constitute its luminous surface;
bearing no remote analogy to our trade-winds&mdash;from
whatever cause arising.&rdquo; More often than
not when a main spot has a train of minor spots
as followers that train will be found extending
eastwards from the east side of the spot, rather
than in any other direction.</p>
<p>Spots remain visible for very diverse lengths
of time, from the extreme of a few minutes up to
a few months; but a few days up to, say, one
month, may, in a general way, be suggested as
their ordinary limits of endurance. As the Sun
rotates on its axis in 25&frac14; days, and as the spots
may be said to be, practically speaking, fixed or
nearly so with respect to the Sun&rsquo;s body, no spot
can remain continuously visible for more than
about 12&frac12; days, being half the duration of the
Sun&rsquo;s axial rotation.</p>
<p>With regard to their size, spots vary as much
as they do in their duration. The majority of
them are telescopic, that is, are only visible with
the aid of a telescope; but instances are not uncommon
of spots sufficiently large to be visible
to the naked eye. The ancients knew nothing
about the physical constitution of the Sun, and
their few allusions to the subject were mere
guesses of the wildest character. They were,
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
however, able to notice now and then that when
the Sun was near the horizon certain black spots
could sometimes be distinguished with the naked
eye, but they took these for planets in conjunction
with the Sun, or phenomena of unknown origin.
Earliest in point of date of those who have left
on record accounts of naked eye sun-spots are undoubtedly
the Chinese. In a species of Cyclop&aelig;dia
ascribed to a certain Ma-touan-lin (whose
records of comets have been of the greatest possible
use to astronomers), we find an account of
45 sun-spots seen during a period of 904 years,
from 301 <span class="sc">A. D.</span> to 1205 <span class="sc">A. D.</span> In order to convey
an idea of the relative size of the spots, the observers
compared them to eggs, dates, plums, etc.,
as the case might be. The observations often
extended over several days; some indeed to as
many as ten consecutive days, and there seem no
grounds for doubting the authenticity of the observations
thus handed down to us. A few stray
observations of sun-spots were recorded in Europe
before the invention of the telescope. Adelmus,
a Benedictine monk, makes mention of a
black spot on the Sun on March 17, 807. It is
also stated that such a spot was seen by Averr&ouml;es
in 1161. Kepler himself seems to have unconsciously
once seen a spot on the Sun with the
naked eye, though he supposed he was looking at
a transit of the planet Mercury. None of these
early observers have told us the way in which
they made their observations, but the smallest of
boys who has any claim to scientific knowledge is
aware of the fact, that by the use of so simple an
expedient as a piece of glass blackened with
smoke, spots which are of sufficient size can be
seen with the naked eye. Before telescopes came
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
into use it was customary to receive the solar
rays in a dark chamber through a little circular
hole cut in a shutter. It was thus that J. Fabricius
succeeded in December 1610 in seeing a considerable
spot and following its movement sufficiently
well to enable him to determine roughly
the period of the Sun&rsquo;s rotation.</p>
<p>The spots may often be easily observed with
telescopes of small dimensions, taking care, however,
to place in front of the eye-piece a piece of
strongly-coloured glass. For this purpose glasses
of various colours are used, but none so good as
dark green or dark neutral tint. It is not altogether
easy to say positively how large a spot
must be for it to be visible with the naked eye,
or an opera glass, but probably it may be taken
generally that no spot of lesser diameter than 1&prime;
of arc can be so seen. This measurement must
be deemed to apply to that central portion of a
normal spot already mentioned as being what is
called the nucleus, because penumbr&aelig; may be
more than 1&prime; in diameter without being visible to
the naked eye, for the reason that their shading
is so much less pronounced than the shading of
umbr&aelig;. Very large and conspicuous spots are
comparatively rare, though during the years 1893
and 1894 there were an unusual number of such
spots. It often happens that a conspicuous group
is the result of the merging or joining up of several
smaller groups. In such cases a group may
extend over an area on the Sun 3&prime; or 4&prime; of arc in
length by 2&prime; or 3&prime; in breadth. The largest spot
on record seems to have been one seen on September
30, 1858, the length of which in one direction
amounted to more than 140,000 miles.</p>
<p>The observation of spots on the Sun by projecting
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
them on to a white paper screen with the
aid of a telescope is a method so convenient and
so exact as to deserve a detailed description, the
more so as it is so little used. Let there be made
in the shutter of a darkened room a hole so much
larger than the diameter of the telescope to be
used as will allow a certain amount of play to the
telescope tube, backwards and forwards, up and
down, and from right to left. Direct the telescope
to the Sun and draw out the eye-piece to
such a distance from the object-glass as that the
image projected on a white screen held behind
may be sharply defined at its edges. If there are
any spots on the Sun at the time they will then
be seen clearly exhibited on the screen. An
image obtained in this way is reversed as compared
with the image seen by looking at the Sun
through a telescope directly. If therefore the
telescope is armed with the ordinary astronomical
eye-piece, which inverts, then the projection will
be direct, that is to say, on the screen the N. S.
E. and W. points will correspond with the same
terrestrial points. Under such circumstances the
spots will be seen to enter the Sun&rsquo;s disc on the
E. side and to go off on the W. side. The contrary
condition of things would arise if a Galilean
telescope or a terrestrial telescope of any kind
were made use of. These instruments erect the
image, and therefore will give by projection a reversed
image, in which we shall see the spots
moving apparently in a direction contrary to their
true direction.</p>
<p>If the reader has grasped the broad general
outlines now given respecting the Sun and its
spots he will perhaps be interested to learn a few
further details, but these must be presented in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
somewhat disjointed fashion, because the multitude
of facts on record concerning sun-spots are
so great as to render a methodical treatment of
them extremely difficult within the limits here
imposed on me. These matters have been gone
into in a very exhaustive way by Secchi in his
great treatise on the Sun, and in what follows I
have made much use of his observations.</p>
<p>Let us look a little further into the laws regulating
the movement of the spots. If it is not
a question of seeing a spot spring into view, but
of watching one already in existence, we shall, in
general, see such a spot appear on the Eastern
limb of the Sun just after having turned the corner,
so to speak. The spots traverse the Sun&rsquo;s
disc in lines which are apparently oblique with
reference to the diurnal movement and the plane
of the ecliptic, and after about 13 days they will
disappear at the Western limb if they have not
done so before by reason of physical changes in
their condition. It is not uncommon for a spot
after remaining invisible for 13 days on the other
side of the Sun, so to speak, to reappear on the
Eastern limb and make a second passage across
the Sun; sometimes a third, and indeed sometimes
even a fourth, passage may be observed, but
more generally they change their form and vanish
altogether either before passing off the visible
disc, or whilst they are on the opposite side as
viewed from the Earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Change of Form in Sun-spots owing to the Sun&rsquo;s rotation.</span></p>
</div>
<p>When several spots appear simultaneously,
they describe in the same period of time similar
paths which are sensibly parallel to one another
although they may be in very different latitudes.
The conclusion from this is inevitable, that spots
are not bodies independent of the Sun, as satellites
would be, but that they are connected with
the Sun&rsquo;s surface, and are affected by its movement
of rotation. If we make every day for a
few days in succession a drawing of the Sun&rsquo;s
disc with any spots that are visible duly marked
thereon, we shall see that their apparent progress
is rapid near the centre of the Sun, but slow near
either limb. These differences, however, are apparent
and not real, for their movement appears
to us to take place along a plane surface, whilst
in reality it takes place along a circle parallel to
the solar equator. The spots in approaching the
Sun&rsquo;s W. limb, if they happen to seem somewhat
circular in form when near the centre, first become
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
oval, and then seem to contract almost into
mere lines. These changes are simple effects of
perspective, and are to be explained in the same
manner as the apparent decrease in the size of
many of the spots is often explicable. But this
condition of things proves, however, that the spots
belong to the actual surface of the Sun, for, on a
contrary supposition, we should have to regard
them as circular bodies greatly flattened like
lozenges, and this would be contrary to all we
know of the forms affected by the heavenly bodies.
Of course besides the apparent changes of form
just alluded to as the effect of perspective, it is
abundantly certain that solar spots often undergo
very real changes of form, not only from day to
day, but in the course of a few hours. Several
spots will often become amalgamated into one, and
it was ephemeral changes of this character which
hindered generally the early observers from determining
with precision the duration of the Sun&rsquo;s
rotation.</p>
<p>The apparent movements of the spots vary
also from month to month during the year according
to the season. In March their paths are
very elongated ellipses with the convexity towards
the N., the longer axis of the ellipse being almost
parallel to the ecliptic. After that epoch the curvature
of the ellipse diminishes gradually, at the
same time that the major axis becomes inclined
to the ecliptic, so that by June the flattening of
the ellipse has proceeded so far that the path has
become a straight line. Between June and September
the elliptical form reappears but in a reversed
position; then, following these reversed
phases, the ellipticity decreases, and for the second
time there is an epoch of straight lines. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
happens in December, but the straight lines are
inclined in a converse direction to that which was
the case in June. It must again be impressed on
the reader that all these seemingly different forms
of path pursued by the spots are merely effects of
perspective, for in reality, the spots in crossing
the Sun&rsquo;s disc describe lines which are virtually
parallel to the solar equator. These projections
really depend of course on the position of the
observer on the Earth, and vary as his position
varies during the Earth&rsquo;s annual circuit round
the Sun. The number of the spots varies through
wide limits. Sometimes they are so numerous that
a single observation will enable us to recognise the
position of the zones of maximum frequency.
Sometimes, on the other hand, they are so scarce,
that many weeks may pass away without hardly
one being seen. A remarkable regularity is now
recognised in the succession of these periods of
abundance and scarcity, as we shall see later on.</p>
<p>It is both useful and interesting in studying
the spots to record methodically their number
and their size, but it is not easy to teach observers
how to do this so systematically that observations
by one person can be brought into comparison
with those of another. Photography and
hand-drawing on a screen alone furnish a trustworthy
basis of operations. Spots in general may
naturally be classified into (1) isolated spots or
points, and (2) groups of spots; but often one
observer will describe as a small spot an object
which another observer would regard as a mere
point; and one observer will record several
groups where another observer will see but one.
A very few days&rsquo; experience with a telescope will
bring home to the observer&rsquo;s mind the difficulty
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
of dealing with the spots where it is a question of
systematic methodical observation of them.</p>
<p>Let us now take a brief survey of some of the
theories which have been put forth regarding the
nature of the spots on the Sun. In the early days
of the telescope, that is to say, during the 17th
century, two general ideas were current. Some
thought the spots to be shapeless satellites revolving
round the Sun; others that they were
clouds, or aggregations of smoke, floating about
in a solar atmosphere. Scheiner, the author of
the first theory, abandoned it towards the close
of his life, having arrived at the conclusion that
the spots were situated below the general level
of the Sun&rsquo;s surface. Another idea, but of later
date, was that the Sun is a liquid and incandescent
mass of matter, and the spots immense
fragments of <i>Scori&aelig;</i>, or clinkers, floating upon an
ocean of fire.</p>
<p>Somewhat more than a century after the spots
had been generally studied with the aid of a telescope
a Scotchman named Wilson made a memorable
discovery. He showed by the clearest evidence
that they are cavities, and he propounded
the first intelligible idea of the true physical constitution
of the Sun, when he compared to a
strongly illuminated cloud the luminous layer of
solar material which we now term the &ldquo;photosphere.&rdquo;
On November 22, 1769, he observed on
the Sun&rsquo;s disc a fine round spot encompassed by
a penumbra, also circular, and concentric with
the nucleus. He watched that spot up to the
time that it disappeared, and he soon remarked
that the penumbra ceased to be symmetrical: the
part turned towards the centre of the Sun became
smaller and smaller, and eventually disappeared
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
altogether; whilst the part on the opposite side
preserved its fulness and dimensions almost unchanged.
Let us suppose we chanced to turn a
telescope on to the Sun on a given day, and were
fortunate enough to discover a spot in the centre
of the disc, with a penumbra concentric with the
nucleus. When such a spot arrives about midway
towards the limb, it will exhibit a penumbra narrower
on the left side than on the right; later on
the penumbra will disappear almost or quite completely
on the left side: then the nucleus itself
will seem to be encroached upon. Finally, very
near the limb, there will remain only a slender
thread of penumbra, and the nucleus will have
ceased to be directly visible. Such were the
phases of transformation observed by Wilson and
often studied since. Wilson suspected that he
had come upon some great law that was ripe for
disclosure, and in order not to be misled he
waited for the return of the same spot, which indeed
reappeared on the Sun&rsquo;s W. limb after
about 14 days. Then he found himself face to
face with the same phases reproduced, but in the
reverse order: the penumbra contracted on one
side and full on the other, widening out on the
contracted side as the spot came up to the Sun&rsquo;s
centre. Henceforth doubt was no longer possible;
the spot had sensibly preserved the same
shape during its passage, and the alterations
noticed were only apparent, and resulted from an
effect of perspective which was easy to be understood.
The different phases presented by such a
spot as that just spoken of will be so much the
more sensible according as the depth of the cavity
is greater; but if the depth is inconsiderable
the bottom of the cavity will only disappear when
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
a very oblique angle is attained, and this cannot
happen except when the spot is very near to the
limb. By observations carefully made under such
circumstances it will be possible to determine the
depth of the cavity, and Wilson found that the
depth of a spot often amounted to about one-third
of the Earth&rsquo;s radius. Wilson&rsquo;s theory was
not accepted without dispute; it was contested
by several astronomers, and in particular by
Lalande. It was however taken up by Sir W.
Herschel, and as modified by him has met with
general acceptance down to the present time;
though now and again challenged, perhaps most
recently and most vehemently by Howlett, a sun
spot observer of great experience. Wilson&rsquo;s discovery
was the point of departure for the grand
labours of Sir W. Herschel in the field of Solar
Physics. Man of genius that Herschel was, he
was above all things an observer who took his
own line in what he did. He saw so many phenomena
with the powerful instruments constructed
by himself, he described so minutely
the marvels which were revealed to him, that he
left comparatively little for his successors to do
so far as regards mere telescopic observation.
Herschel&rsquo;s main idea as to the Sun was based on
Wilson&rsquo;s discovery. He remarked with reason,
as that astronomer had done, that if the spots
are cavities the luminous matter could neither be
properly called liquid nor gaseous; for then it
would precipitate itself with frightful rapidity to
fill up the void, and that would render it impossible
that the spots should endure as we often see
they do during several revolutions of the Sun.
Moreover, the proper movements of the spots
prove that the photosphere is not solid. We can
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
therefore only liken it to fogs or clouds, and it
must be suspended in an atmosphere similar to
ours. Such is, according to Herschel, the only
hypothesis which can explain the rapid changes
which we witness. We shall see a little later on
that these phenomena do admit of another explanation.</p>
<p>In a second memoir Herschel followed up this
inquiry with an acuteness worthy of his genius.
Unfortunately he allowed himself to be carried
away with the idea that the Sun was inhabited in
order to sustain this theory. He needed a solid
kernel upon which his imaginary inhabitants could
dwell; and also a means whereby he could protect
them from the radiations of the photosphere.
With this idea in view he conjectured the existence
above the Sun&rsquo;s solid body of a layer of
clouds always contiguous to the photosphere
which enveloped it, and which always being rent
when the photosphere was rent, thus enabled us
to see the solid body of the Sun lying behind.
These notions can only be described as very arbitrary,
as unsupported by observation, and as
involving explanations quite out of harmony with
the principles of modern physics. However, the
labours of Herschel resulted in so many positive
discoveries of visible facts, and in so many just
conclusions, that they contributed greatly to the
growth of our present knowledge of the true constitution
of the Sun.</p>
<p>Since Wilson&rsquo;s time, as Secchi pointedly remarks,
astronomers generally have verified his
observations with good instruments, and by an
investigation of a great number of spots. De La
Rue, discussing the Kew observations, found that
of 89 regular spots 72 gave results which conformed
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
to Wilson&rsquo;s ideas, whilst the remaining 17
were opposed thereto. There is nothing surprising
in the existence of a contrarient minority
when we consider the great changes which in
reality often occur in the forms of the spots. De
La Rue suggested a very simple expedient for
showing that the spots are cavities. Take two
photographs of the Sun made at an interval of
one day: during that time every point on the
Sun&rsquo;s surface will have been displaced, so far as
the telescope is concerned, by about 15&deg;. Place
these photographs in a stereoscope, and we shall
readily see the interior cavity, the edges of which
will appear raised above the photosphere. It is
impossible therefore to entertain the least doubt
as to the truth of the theory that the spots are
excavations in the luminous stratum which envelopes
the whole of the solar globe.</p>
<p>If it be true that a spot is a cavity, it follows
that when it reaches the margin of the solar disc
we ought to detect a hollow place; and this will
be so much the more easy to observe according as
the cavity is larger and deeper. As a matter of
fact, numerous observations of this sort have been
recorded from the time of Cassini down to the
present time under the designation of &ldquo;notches&rdquo;
on the Sun&rsquo;s limb. On July 8, 1873, Secchi observed
such a notch 8&Prime;, or 3600 miles deep.</p>
<p>Faye and some other astronomers are disposed
to support a theory according to which the spots
are nothing else than a&euml;rial cyclones, but this
does not seem admissible. If the fundamental
principle of a spot is that it arises from a whirling
movement, the rays (so to speak) which compose
the penumbr&aelig; must always be crooked, or
the theory falls to the ground. It is quite true
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
that indications of cyclonic action do sometimes
appear, but they are at any rate very rare, for
only a small percentage exhibit in a distinct manner
a spiral structure. Moreover, when such a
structure is seen it does not endure for the whole
lifetime of the spot but only for a day or two: the
spot may last a long time after it has lost its spiral
features, if it ever had any. Sometimes even the
whirling movement, after having slackened, begins
again, but in the contrary direction. Under these
circumstances, though this occasional spiral structure
is very curious and interesting, we are not
justified in taking it as the basis of a theory which
has any pretensions to explain the general nature
of sun-spots.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>When we examine the Sun with instruments of
large aperture and high magnifying power, we notice
that its surface is far from being as smooth
and uniform as it appears in a small telescope.
On the contrary, it presents an irregular undulating
appearance like a pond or other sheet of water
agitated by the wind. Careful scrutiny with a
powerful eye-piece reveals the fact that the Sun&rsquo;s
surface is marked by a multitude of wrinkles and
irregularities which it is well-nigh impossible to
describe in words. More or less everywhere there
is a general mottling visible; it is more distinct
in some places than others, and especially so
towards the centre of the disc. This peculiar
appearance varies very much from time to time,
and its distinctness seems to depend a great deal
on the state of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, for it becomes
invisible when the air is disturbed; but
these variations depend also on real variations of
the photosphere&mdash;a fact which observations made
in very calm weather are thought clearly to indicate.</p>
<p>It is often said that the Sun exhibits a granulated
structure. If we wish to realise in the most
precise manner what is meant by the word &ldquo;granulation&rdquo;
as applied to the structure of the Sun,
we must abandon the method of projection and
examine the Sun directly with a powerful eyepiece,
taking advantage of a moment when the
atmosphere is perfectly calm, and before the eyepiece
has had time to get hot. It may then be
seen that the Sun&rsquo;s surface is covered with a multitude
of little grains, nearly all of about the same
size, but of different shape, though for the most
part more or less oval. The small interstices
which separate these grains form a network
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
which is dark without being positively black.
Secchi considered it difficult to name any known
object which exactly answers in appearance to
this structure, but he thought that we can find
something resembling it in examining with a microscope
milk which has been a little dried up, and
the globules of which have lost their regular form.
Exceptionally good atmospheric conditions are under
all circumstances indispensable for the study
of these details.</p>
<p>In point of fact, there is a mysterious uncertainty
about the normal condition of the Sun&rsquo;s
surface, in a visual sense, which a few years ago
engendered a very vehement controversy, and led
to the use of such expressions as &ldquo;willow leaves,&rdquo;
&ldquo;rice grains,&rdquo; &ldquo;sea beach,&rdquo; and &ldquo;straw thatching,&rdquo;
to indicate what was seen. All these words are
too precise to be quite suitable to be taken literally,
but perhaps, on the whole, &ldquo;rice grains&rdquo;
is not altogether a bad expression to recall what
certainly seems to be the granular surface of the
Sun as we see it.</p>
<p>By making use of moderate magnifying powers,
what we see will often convey the impression of
a multitude of white points on a black network.
This is very apparent during the first few moments
that the telescope is brought to bear on
the Sun, but its clearness quickly passes away
because the eye gets fatigued, and the lenses
becoming warm the air in the telescope tube gets
disturbed because also warmed. Sometimes the
appearance is a little different from that just
described, and along with the white and brilliant
points little black holes are intermixed. Oftentimes
the grains appear as if suspended in a black
network and heaped together in knots more or
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
less shaded and more or less broad. Sometimes
the grains exhibit a very elongated form, especially
in the neighbourhood of the spots. It is these
elongated forms to which Nasmyth applied the
term &ldquo;willow leaf,&rdquo; whilst Huggins thought
&ldquo;rice grains&rdquo; a very suitable expression.</p>
<p>This granular or leaf-like structure&mdash;call it
what we will&mdash;cannot be made out except with
considerable optical assistance, for the grains
being intrinsically very small, diffraction in enlarging
them and causing them to encroach on
one another necessarily produces a general confusion
of image. The real dimensions of these
grains cannot therefore readily be determined
by direct measurement, but by comparing them
with the wires used in micrometer eye-pieces it
has been thought that their diameters may usually
be regarded as equal to &frac14; or &#8531; of a second&mdash;say
from 120 to 150 miles. The granules seem to
be possessed of sensible movement, but presumably
it is not always or even generally a movement of
translation from place to place; only an undulatory
movement like that of still water when a stone is
cast into it. Nevertheless, probably in certain
cases the granules actually are affected by a
motion of translation, for in the vicinity of spots
they may sometimes be seen flowing over the
edges of the penumbr&aelig;. In order to explain the
existence of the granules the strangest theories
have been broached. Sir William Herschel having
observed the granulations, applied to them
the term &ldquo;corrugations&rdquo; or &ldquo;furrows&rdquo;&mdash;words
somewhat inexact, perhaps, but by which, as his
descriptions clearly show, he meant to designate
the features which I am now treating of. He
even noticed the dark network which separates
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
the grains, and he applied to it the word &ldquo;indentations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These granulations are without doubt prominences,
probably of hydrogen gas, which rise
above the general surface, for this structure is
much more sharp and distinct at the centre of
the sun&rsquo;s disc than at the limbs; that is to say,
near the limbs of the Sun they partially overlap
one another, as indeed Herschel remarked. The
idea of flames would satisfy these appearances:
and as the spectroscope suggests to us that the
Sun is habitually covered over with a multitude
of little jets of flame, the observations which have
been made compel the opinion that the grains are
the summits of those prominences which exist all
over the Sun&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>The surface is sometimes so thickly covered
over with these granulations&mdash;the network is so
conspicuous&mdash;that we can readily imagine that
we see everywhere pores and the beginnings of
spots, but this aspect is not permanent, and seems
to depend to some extent on atmospheric causes
combined also with actual changes in the Sun&rsquo;s
surface itself. There seems however no doubt
that the joints, so to speak, of the dark network
already referred to do sometimes burst asunder
and develope into spots.</p>
<p>The circumstances which accompany the formation
of a spot cannot readily be specified with
certainty. It is impossible to say that there
exists any law as to this matter. Whilst some
spots develope very slowly by the expansion of
certain pores, others spring into existence quite
suddenly. Yet it cannot be said that the formation
of a spot is ever completely instantaneous
however rapid it may be. The phenomenon is
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
often announced some days in advance: we may
perceive in the photosphere a great agitation
which often manifests itself by some very brilliant
<i>facul&aelig;</i> (to be described presently) giving birth to
one or more pores. Very often we next notice
some groups of little black spots, as if the luminous
stratum was becoming thinner in such a
way as to disappear little by little and leave a
large black nucleus uncovered. At the commencement
of the business there is usually no
clearly defined penumbra. This developes itself
gradually and acquires a regular outline, just as
the spot itself often takes a somewhat circular
form. This tranquil and peaceable formation of
a spot only happens at a time when calm seems
to reign in the solar atmosphere: in general the
development is more tumultuous and the stages
more complicated.</p>
<p>As a rule a spot passes through three stages of
existence:&mdash;(1) the Period of birth; (2) a Period
of calm; and (3) the Period of dissolution. When
a spot is on the point of closing up, the flow of
the luminous matter which it, as it were, attracts,
is not directed uniformly towards the centre; it
seems that the photospheric masses, no longer
meeting with resistance, are precipitated promiscuously
anywhere so as to fill up the hole. It is
impossible to describe in detail the phases which
irregular spots go through, but two things may
always be remarked: that their structure is characterized
by the existence of luminous filaments,
and that these filaments converge towards one or
several centres.</p>
<p>Secchi thus sums up certain conclusions which
he arrived at relating to spots generally:&mdash;(1) It
is not on the surface of any solid body that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
solar spots are manifested; they are produced in
a fluid mass, the fluidity of which is represented
by a gas, so that the constitution of this medium
may be likened to that of flames or clouds; (2)
the known details respecting the constitution of
the penumbra and the phenomena exhibited prove
that the penumbra is not a mass of obscure matter
which floats across luminous matter, but that
it is on the contrary a case of luminous matter
invading and floating about over darker materials
and so producing a half tint.</p>
<p>All the available evidence which we possess
may be said to show that the spots are not merely
superficial appearances, but that they have their
origin deep in the interior of the Sun, and are
produced by the operation of causes still unknown
to us which affect and disturb the Sun&rsquo;s mass to
an extent which is sometimes very considerable.
The spots then are only the results of a great
agitation in the materials of which the Sun is
composed, and this agitation extends far down
below the limits of the visible dark nucleus whatever
that may consist of.</p>
<p>Besides the spots, streaks of light may frequently
be remarked upon the surface of the Sun
towards the margin of the disc. These are termed
<i>facul&aelig;</i> (torches), and they are often found near
the spots, or where spots have previously existed
or have afterwards appeared. When quite near
the Sun&rsquo;s limb these facul&aelig; are usually more or
less parallel to the limb. They are of irregular
form and may be likened to certain kinds of coral.
They generally appear to be more luminous than
the solar surface immediately adjacent to them,
but it is not improbable that this is an optical illusion
depending upon the fact that the edges of
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
the Sun always appear much more luminous than
the centre. This last-named fact may be readily
recognised by the employment of a high magnifying
power, and moving the telescope rapidly from
the limb to the centre of the disc. If the Sun be
projected on a screen, as already mentioned, this
degradation of the Sun&rsquo;s light from centre to circumference
becomes particularly manifest.</p>
<p>After having studied the structure and the
movement of the spots, one is naturally led to ask
if their apparitions at different periods are subject
to any general law. This question is one
which has much engaged the attention of modern
astronomers. The older observers noticed that
the number of the spots visible differed in different
years. There were said to have been periods
when months and even years passed away without
any spots being observed. Even allowing that
this statement, so far as &ldquo;years&rdquo; are concerned,
might be exaggerated, and that the absence of
spots was due to the want of sufficient care in
making the observations, and especially to the
want of efficient instruments, it is none the less
true that the number of the spots is extremely
variable, and that there have been epochs when
they were very scarce.</p>
<p>Sir W. Herschel was the first who devoted
himself to the question of seeking to establish a
relation between the variation of the spots and
terrestrial meteorology. For the want of any
better object, he compared the annual number of
the spots with the price of wheat; but it is easy
to see that nothing could result from such a
comparison. Without doubt the meteorological
phenomena of the globe must depend to some extent
on solar changes: but the term of comparison
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
selected by Herschel had no direct bearing
on the state of the Sun.</p>
<p>In our time this question has been investigated
to its very foundation by Wolf, Director for
many years at the Observatory of Zurich. It is
to his zeal that we owe a very interesting assemblage
of old observations which were buried in
archives and chronicles. It was he who endeavoured
to reduce them into a systematic form, so
as to supply as far as possible the numerous gaps
which exist in the different series.</p>
<p>The two most attentive observers at the period
when the spots were discovered were Marriott at
Oxford and Scheiner at Ingoldstadt, but Scheiner
himself has informed us that he did not note down
all the spots which he saw; he only recorded
those which were likely to assist him in his special
task of determining the period of the Sun&rsquo;s
rotation. Several observers after him made isolated
series of observations; but some of these
have been lost and the others show important
gaps. J. G. Staudacher, at Nuremburg, observed
the Sun with great perseverance during fifty years
from 1749 to 1799. Before him the Cassinis, Maraldi,
and others were engaged in the same sort of
work, but only in an indirect way: that is to say,
they contented themselves, whilst making meridional
observations of the Sun, with noting anything
in the way of spots which they deemed
important. Zucconi and Flaugergues also left
behind them a good collection of observations
which Wolf utilised, rendering them comparable
one with another by applying suitable corrections.
The great difficulty herein arises from the fact
that the observers were not provided with instruments
of equal power; one man, armed with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
better telescope than his contemporaries, naturally
observed and recorded spots which would
escape the others. The numbers entered in their
registers are therefore not comparable <i>inter se</i>.
Wolf endeavoured to replace these numbers by
others which would represent the spots which
might have been seen if the observers had all
employed telescopes of a given kind and power.
The result of his efforts in this direction is an almost
continuous series of Sun-spot records from
an epoch sufficiently remote, up to the time when
this branch of science was taken up with the
vigour of modern scientific methods.</p>
<p>The observer who most assiduously devoted
himself to this subject in modern times was
Schwabe of Dessau. From 1826 to 1868 he never
failed to make daily observations when the
weather permitted him. His series of records is
specially valuable, for Carrington&rsquo;s fits in with it,
and with that in turn Sp&ouml;rer&rsquo;s is comparable, and
the chain is complete by the later photographic
and other observations. All these Sun-spot records,
though differing in their details, may easily
be used together when it is a question of working
out relative annual fluctuations.</p>
<p>At the present time there are many Astronomers
who are engaged in observing the spots
with care; but just as formerly there are few
who possess sufficient perseverance. The photographic
method is excellent, but it takes much
time and is costly. Some have decried, in a very
unreasonable manner, a drawing made by hand:
such a drawing, of sufficient size, and executed
by projection by a skilful draughtsman with a
telescope driven by clockwork, may stand comparison
with a photograph, and this method has
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
a better chance of being persevered in. The
Rev. F. Howlett&rsquo;s name must be mentioned in
this connection as a draughtsman who has accomplished
much by hand drawing. Though the
once famous Kew observations have been discontinued,
they have been replaced by a new series
at Greenwich with similar appliances; whilst
Janssen at Meudon has also been carrying on for
a number of years a splendid course of photographic
records.</p>
<p>Schwabe, when he had collected a considerable
number of observations, recognised clear indications
of periodicity. Very definite epochs of
maxima and minima succeeded one another at
intervals of 10 or 11 years. It is true that in following
out such a study the observations are certain
to be in a sense a little defective. At first it
was not possible to observe the Sun every day,
and the gaps which resulted from bad weather
necessarily added to the number of days which
had to be set down as being without spots. Moreover,
every method of numbering the spots must
be a little arbitrary: there are often groups
which, in consequence of their sub-divisions, may
be counted in different ways: but in a mass of
observations so considerable as those of Schwabe&rsquo;s,
such uncertainties will compensate for one another
and will disappear in the final result. In fact the
law is so striking that it suffices to cast one&rsquo;s eye
over his table<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> to see that.</p>
<p>That table is both interesting and instructive
at the same time. The numbers exhibited in it
speak for themselves, and it is sufficient to examine
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
them with even a small amount of attention
to realise the certainty of the conclusions which
have been drawn.</p>
<p>It is therefore now to be deemed an ascertained
fact that there are periodical maxima and
minima in the display of spots, and that the extent
of the period is between 10 and 12 years. In
order to determine this value with the utmost
exactness, some astronomers have had recourse
to early observations. Wolf of Zurich made this
the subject of some very interesting inquiries. He
was able to establish the chronology of the phases
which the Sun has passed through from the time
of the first discovery of the spots to the present
day&mdash;more than 2&frac12; centuries. His calculations
led him to a period of 11<sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub> years. Lamont fixed
upon 10.43 years, but this number does not represent
the more recent observations with sufficient
precision.</p>
<p>In order to exhibit this law in the plainest
possible manner the dates of maxima and minima
should be laid down on ruled paper in proper
mathematical form, the <i>absciss&aelig;</i> of the curve representing
the years, and the <i>ordinates</i> the number
of spots observed.</p>
<p>An examination of a curve thus plotted shows
two things:&mdash;(1) That the period is clearly an
eleven-year one, as has been already stated; (2)
that it is not however quite as simple in its form
as it was at first thought to be; for in reality
there are two periods superposed, the one rather
more than half a century long, and the other extending
over the 11 years already spoken of.
We do not possess early observations sufficiently
numerous and sufficiently good to enable us to
draw any unimpeachable conclusions as to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
nature of the long period; we can only be certain
that it exists. The later labours of Wolf, however,
fixed that period at 55&frac12; years. It is a result
of this that, according to Loomis, a period of
comparative calm on the Sun existed between 1810
and 1825.</p>
<p>Each maximum lies nearer to the minimum
which precedes it than to the minimum which follows
it, for the spots increase during 3.7 years,
and then diminish during 7.4 years. According
to De La Rue the increase occupies 3.52 years,
and diminution 7.55 years. This concurrence between
De La Rue and Wolf is surprising considering
the diversity of the methods which led to
results almost identical, the one set being based
on the number of the spots, and the other on the
superficial extent of the spots. The different
periods in succession are not absolutely identical:
but it has been remarked that if during any one
period the decrease is retarded or accelerated, then
the increase next following will be lengthened or
contracted to a corresponding extent. In consequence
of this we are sometimes able to predict
with fair accuracy when the next ensuing maximum
or minimum will take place.</p>
<p>The most striking feature of such a curve as
that just alluded to is the very sensible secondary
augmentation which happens very soon after the
principal maximum.</p>
<p>A very curious circumstance has come to light
in connection with the epochs of maxima and
minima. In arranging the spots according to
their latitude and longitude on a diagram sufficiently
contracted, Carrington found that their
latitude decreases gradually as the period of
minimum draws near; then when their number
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
begins to increase they begin to appear again at
a higher latitude. This seems to be a definite
law. At any rate Carrington&rsquo;s conclusion has
been found to hold good by the observations of
Sp&ouml;rer and Secchi.</p>
<p>The variations of the spots which we now recognise
naturally recall those obscurations of the
Sun which are recorded in history; but it is necessary
to accept many of these with caution. A
great number of these phenomena which attracted
the attention of people in early times are only
eclipses badly observed and still more badly described.
In other instances the obscuration has
been produced by very protracted dry fogs. It is
probably to this last-named cause that we must
ascribe the obscuration which, according to Kepler
and Gemma Frisius, took place in 1547.</p>
<p>It was in some such way as this that, according
to Virgil (Georg. i, 630), who has echoed a tradition
which he found in history, the Sun was obscured
at the death of C&aelig;sar:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ille etiam extincto miseratus C&aelig;sare Romam</p>
<p class="t0">Quum caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit,</p>
<p class="t0">Impiaque &aelig;ternam timuerunt s&aelig;cula noctem.</p>
</div>
<p>In the year 553 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, and again in the year
626 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> the Sun remained obscured for several
months; but these facts (if facts they are) besides
being ill-observed, and clothed, no doubt, in extremely
exaggerated language, are brought to our
notice as having occurred at epochs which are
quite independent of one another, whilst the
variations in the markings on the Sun, which we
have just been talking about, present an almost
mathematical regularity of sequence.</p>
<p>We must now institute some inquiries as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
the causes of the periodicity of the spots. A
periodicity so well established would naturally
invite astronomers to seek the causes which produced
it. The presence of spots only in the Zodiacal
regions led Galileo to suspect the existence
of some relation between the spots and the position
of the planets; but there is in this a mere
surmise, which, when it was made, had nothing to
justify it, and it is still impossible for us to say
anything for certain on the point. The determining
cause of the periodicity may exist in the
interior of the Sun, and may depend on circumstances
which will for ever remain unknown to
us. Or it may be something external: it may be
due after all to the influence of the planets. It
remains for us, therefore, to search and see if any
such influence can be traced.</p>
<p>According to Wolf, the attraction of the planets,
or of some of them, is the real cause of the periodicity
which we are dealing with; that attraction
producing on the surface of the solar globe
true tides, which give birth to the spots, these
tides themselves experiencing periodic variations
owing to the periodic changes of position of the
celestial bodies which cause them. It has even
been thought safe to assert that the fact of the
principal period coinciding with the revolution of
Jupiter is of momentous significance; but this
coincidence seems purely accidental, and no certain
conclusion can be drawn as to this matter.
The influence of Mercury and Venus would perhaps
be much more potent, for their distance from
the Sun is not very great, and this should render
their influence more sensible. On the other hand,
their masses appear to be too small to be capable
of producing any sufficient effect.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>De La Rue, Balfour Stewart, and L&ouml;wy most
perseveringly studied this point of solar physics.
They seem to have arrived at the conclusion
that the conjunctions of Venus and Jupiter do
exercise a certain amount of influence on the
number of the spots and on their latitude; and
that this influence is less considerable when Venus
is situated in the plane of the solar equator.
At any rate it is a fact, that a great number of the
visible inequalities in a duly plotted curve of the
spots do really correspond to special positions of
these two planets.</p>
<p>In order to determine with more precision
these coincidences and the importance which attaches
to them, De La Rue extended his inquiries.
He separately analysed many different groups of
spots, selecting for his purpose more particularly
those of which the observations happened to
have been specially continuous and complete,
giving a preference moreover to those which had
been observed in the central portions of the Sun&rsquo;s
disc. From an investigation of 794 groups De
La Rue arrived at the following conclusions:&mdash;(1)
If we take a meridian passing through the
middle of the disc and represented by a diameter
perpendicular to the equator, we find that the
mean size of the spots is not the same with regard
to that meridian. It appears certain that
the correction required for perspective does not
suffice to explain this difference; and that another
element must be introduced in order to secure
that the apparent dimensions of the spots may
be the same on both sides. We do not yet possess
a very clear explanation of this fact; but
the most probable is this:&mdash;the spots are surrounded
by a projecting bank, which seems to
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
disappear in part during their transit across the
Sun. This bank is more elevated on the preceding
than on the following side; accordingly,
the spots ought to seem smaller when they are
in the eastern half of the disc; larger when they
are in the western half; for in the first position
the observer&rsquo;s eye meets an elevated obstacle,
which hides a portion of the spot itself. (2) De
La Rue specially studied the spots observed at
the times when the planets Venus and Mars were
at a heliocentric distance from the Earth equal to
0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees, and arrived at this
result; the spots are larger in the part of the Sun
which is away from Venus and Mars, and they
are smaller on the side on which these planets
happen to be. The same result was obtained,
whether Carrington&rsquo;s figures or the Kew photographs
were employed. (3) Meanwhile it does
not appear that Jupiter emits any similar influence.
This influence should be easily perceived,
for if we calculate the action of the planets in the
way that we calculate the tides, treating it as directly
proportional to the masses and inversely
proportional to the cubes of the distances, the
influence of Jupiter should greatly outweigh that
of Venus.</p>
<p>Wolf thought that he had noticed traces of
some influence being exerted by Saturn; but this
remains altogether without confirmation.</p>
<p>De La Rue noticed that large spots are generally
situated at extremities of the same diameter.
This law also often applies to the development
of large prominences. The coincidence agrees
well with the theory that there exists on the Sun
some action resembling that of our tides.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the amount of probability
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
which attaches to these explanations we ought
not to forget that we are still far off from possessing
the power of giving a vigorous demonstration
of them. If we consider with attention
the periodical variations of the spots we shall not
be long in coming to the conclusion that it is impossible
to connect them directly with any one
astronomical function in particular, for the spots
appear in a sudden and irregular manner which
contrasts in a striking degree with the continuous
and progressive action of the ordinary perturbations
which we meet with in the study of Celestial
Mechanics. There is but one reply possible to
this objection. The spots and their changes must
be visible manifestations of the periodical activity
of the Sun&mdash;an activity which itself depends (as
assumed) on the action of the planets and on
their relative positions. The cause, thus defined,
of the Sun&rsquo;s activity may be very regular; the
activity itself may vary in a continuous manner
without the resulting phenomena possessing the
same continuity and the same regularity. We see
this in the periodical succession of the Seasons on
the Earth. The position of the Sun, and consequently
its manner of acting upon our globe,
varies with a remarkable uniformity, but nevertheless
the meteorological phenomena which result
are irregular and capricious. Thus it comes
about that physicists are more and more inclined
to believe that the spots are only secondary
effects produced by causes more important and
more fundamental.</p>
<p>Whatever may be our ignorance as to the
causes which produce variations in the Sun&rsquo;s activity
we may at least draw one conclusion from
the preceding remarks: it is, that the Sun is a
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
very long way from having arrived at a state of
tranquillity and freedom from internal commotion.
On the contrary, it is the seat of great movements.
Its activity is subject to numberless periodical
changes which ought in their turn to influence the
intensity of the heat and light given out by the
Sun; and so re-act on the planets which receive
their heat, light, and life from the Sun.</p>
<p>No account of the periodicity of the spots on
the Sun can be deemed complete which does not
include information respecting certain other periodical
phenomena which have been found to exhibit
features of alternation closely resembling
in their sequence and character the periodical
changes which take place in regard to the spots
on the Sun. There is evidently a deep mystery
lying hid under the curious fact (which is clearly
established) that the 11-year period of the spots
coincides in a manner as unexpected as it is certain
with the period of the variation of terrestrial
magnetism. The magnetic needle is subject to
a diurnal variation which reaches its extreme
amount every 11 years, and not only so, but the
epoch of maximum variation corresponds with the
epoch of the maximum prevalence of Sun spots.
And similarly years in which the needle is least
disturbed are also years in which the Sun spots
are fewest. Two other very curious discoveries
have also been made which are in evident close
connection with the foregoing. The manifestation
of the Aurora Borealis and of those strange
currents of electricity known as magnetic earth
currents (which travel below the Earth&rsquo;s surface
and frequently interfere with telegraphic operations),
likewise exhibit periodical changes which
take 11 years to go through all their stages. This
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
fact alone would be sufficiently curious, but when
we come to find that the curve which exhibits the
changes these two manifestations of force go
through, also shows that their maxima and minima
are contemporaneous with the maxima and
minima of the Sun spots and magnetic needle
variations, we cannot doubt that (to use Balfour
Stewart&rsquo;s words) &ldquo;a bond of union exists between
these four phenomena. The question next arises,
what is the nature of this bond? Now, with respect
to that which connects Sun spots with magnetic
disturbances we can as yet form no conjecture.&rdquo;
To cut a long story short, it may be said
generally that whilst without doubt electricity is
the common basis of the three last-named of the
four phenomena just mentioned, it seems scarcely
too great a stretch of the imagination to go one
step further and suggest that electricity has in
some or other occult manner something to do
with all these things and therefore with the spots
on the Sun.</p>

<p>The reader who has followed me thus far will
by this time be in a position to appreciate a remark
made in an earlier part of this chapter, that
the multitude of facts known to us in connection
with the Sun and its spots is so great, as to render
it impossible to exhibit in a single chapter anything
more than the barest outline of them. The
numerous observations of recent eclipses of the
Sun, especially since that of 1860, and the extensive
application of the spectroscope to the Sun
both in connection with these eclipses, and generally,
may be said to have completely revolutionised
our knowledge of solar phenomena during
the present generation; or perhaps it might
be more correct to say have enormously increased
our knowledge of the facts of the case and have
revolutionised in no small degree the conclusions
deduced from the facts.</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">MERCURY.</span></h2>
<p>So far as we know at present, Mercury is the
nearest planet to the Sun. The circumstances
under which it presents itself to us and a brief
general account of its movements have already
been stated. In the present chapter, therefore
(and this remark applies in substance to each of
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
the succeeding chapters appropriated to particular
planets), I shall limit myself to such topics as
seem to be of interest to an observer armed with
a telescope. Mercury, as already mentioned, exhibits
from time to time phases which may be
said to be the same as those of the moon; but as
the only chance of seeing it is when it is at its
greatest distance east or west of the Sun, practically
it can only be studied when in, or rather
near to, what may be called the half-moon phase;
and even then observations on its physical appearance
can only be obtained with difficulty.
Perhaps its most definite feature is its colour.
This, undoubtedly, is more or less pink. Strange
to say, in spite of the multiplication of telescopes
and observers, comparatively little attention has
been paid to this planet, and we really know very
little more about it than Schr&ouml;ter told us nearly
a hundred years ago. He obtained what he conceived
to be satisfactory evidence of the existence
of at any rate one mountain, having a height of
about 11 English miles&mdash;a height which it will be
noted, far exceeds, not only relatively but absolutely,
any mountain on the earth. What Schr&ouml;ter
based this conclusion upon was the fact that
when the planet was near inferior conjunction,
the southern horn presented a truncated appearance,
which might be the result of a lofty projection
arresting the Sun&rsquo;s light. Schr&ouml;ter also announced
that Mercury rotated on its axis in 24
hours 5 minutes. Sir W. Herschel failed to satisfy
himself that Schr&ouml;ter&rsquo;s conclusions were well-founded,
but it must certainly be admitted that
some support for them is furnished by certain observations
made within the last few years. It is
matter for regret, however, that most of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
were made with instruments of sizes which, for
the most part, cannot be said to have been equal
to the task to which they were applied. The
truncature of the southern horn first spoken of by
Schr&ouml;ter, was thought by Denning, in 1882, to be
obvious; and in the same year, by watching the
displacement of certain bright and dusky spaces
on the disc, the same observer concluded that a
rotation period of about 25 hours was indicated.</p>
<p>In 1882 Schiaparelli at Milan commenced a
prolonged study of Mercury. Believing that it
was essential to observe through a good condition
of atmosphere, and that this was impossible if the
planet were only looked at in twilight, when it
was necessarily at a low altitude, Schiaparelli
made all his observations with the Sun and planet
high up in the heavens. He considered, in effect,
that the blaze of the Sun&rsquo;s light was a lesser evil
than the tremors inseparable from observations of
the planet, clear it might be in some degree of
inconvenient Sun-light, but viewed through the
vapours and atmospheric disturbances, which always
spoil all observations near the horizon.
Schiaparelli&rsquo;s observations yielded various results,
most of them novel, and one of them very startling.
He considers Mercury to be a much spotted
globe and to be enveloped in a tolerably dense
atmosphere. He thought he noticed brownish
stripes and streaks (which might be regarded as
permanent markings), more clearly visible on
some occasions than on others; and that these
systematically disappeared near the limb, owing
to the increased depth there of the atmosphere
through which they had to be looked at.</p>
<p>The foregoing observations may be regarded
as not unreasonable; they may even be accepted
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
without further question. But what are we to say
to Schiaparelli&rsquo;s conclusions that these markings
are so nearly permanent, taking one day with another,
that Mercury&rsquo;s rotation cannot be measured
in hours at all, but is a matter of days,&mdash;in
point of fact, of 88 days; and that in reality Mercury
occupies in its rotation on its axis the whole
of the 88 days which constitute its sidereal year,
or period of revolution round the Sun. The counterpart
of this for us would be that, instead of the
inhabitants of the earth having a day of 24 hours,
they would have only one day and night every
365 days. Astronomers are not at present satisfied
to accept this conclusion in regard to Mercury.</p>
<p>Some observers have thought that Mercury is
more easy to observe than Venus, and that, speaking
generally, its surface, if we could only get to
see it constantly under favourable circumstances,
might be considered to resemble in most respects
that of Mars. Mercury revolves round the Sun at
a mean distance of 36 millions of miles. Owing,
however, to the fact that the eccentricity of its
orbit (or its departure from the circular form)
is greater than that of any of the other major
planets, it may approach to within 28&frac12; millions of
miles or recede to more than 43 millions of miles.
Its apparent diameter varies between 4&frac12;&Prime; in superior
conjunction to 13&Prime; in inferior conjunction.
The real diameter may be taken at about 3000
miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">VENUS.</span></h2>
<p>The planet Venus has two things in common
with Mercury. One is, that being an inferior
planet, that is to say, a planet revolving round
the Sun in an orbit within that of the Earth, it is
never very far distant from the Sun, and therefore
can never be seen on a distinctly dark sky.
The second point alluded to arises out of the
first; Venus exhibits from time to time a series
of phases which are identical in character with
those of Mercury, and therefore with those of the
Moon. Venus differs, however, from Mercury in
the very important point of size. Inasmuch as
its diameter is considerably more than double the
diameter of Mercury it has a surface more than
six times as great, and therefore exhibits a far
larger area of illumination than Mercury does.
The result of this (coupled with another fact
which will be stated presently) is that the planet
may often be easily seen in broad daylight, and
sometimes casts a sensible shadow at night. Under
special circumstances, which recur every 8
years, this planet shines with very peculiar brilliancy.
True, that only about &frac14;th of the whole
disc is then illuminated, but that fraction transmits
to us more light than phases of greater extent
do, because these latter coincide with epochs
when the planet is more remote from the Earth.</p>
<p>Spots and shadings have on various occasions
been noticed on Venus, and though it is not easy
to harmonise the various accounts, there seems
no doubt of the reality of the facts, or that they
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
must be ascribed to the existence of mountains.
Schr&ouml;ter found very much the same state of
things to exist on Venus that he found on Mercury,
and putting together what he saw he arrived
at the conclusion that Venus possesses
mountains of considerable height, and that his
observations must be taken to imply that the
planet revolved on its axis in rather more than
23 hours. This conclusion as regards the planet&rsquo;s
axial rotation was not first arrived at by Schr&ouml;ter,
for the two Cassinis, one about 1666, and the
other about 1740, both ascribed to Venus a rotation
period of about 23 hours, an evaluation which
was fully confirmed by Di Vico at Rome between
1839 and 1841, and by Flammarion in 1894.</p>
<p>What has been already said with respect to
Mercury is true also of Venus, namely that it has
been much neglected by modern observers; and
accordingly an announcement made by Schiaparelli
in 1890, that the rotation period of Venus
is to be measured not by hours but by months,
came upon the astronomical world as a startling
revelation; but it is a revelation which has been
keenly contested, and certainly awaits legal proof.
Schiaparelli has not ventured to assert as he has
done in the case of Mercury, that Venus&rsquo;s rotation
period is identical with the period of 7&frac12; months
in which it revolves round the Sun; he only
claims this as a strong probability arising out of
what he says he is certain of, namely that its
period of rotation cannot be less than six months
and may be as much as nine months. His assumption
is that previous observers in endeavouring
to ascertain Venus&rsquo;s rotation period have
used and relied upon evanescent shadings which
probably were of atmospheric origin and scarcely
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
recognisable from day to day, whereas he fixed
his attention upon round defined white spots,
which, whatever their origin, are so far permanent
that their existence has been spoken of for two
centuries. Miss Clarke thus puts the matter:&mdash;&ldquo;His
steady watch over them showed the invariability
of their position with regard to the
terminator; and this is as much as to say that the
regions of day and night do not shift on the surface
of the planet. In other words she keeps the
same face always turned towards the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various recent observations, some of them
made with the express object of throwing light
upon Schiaparelli&rsquo;s conclusions, are strangely contradictory.
Perrotin at Nice in 1890 thought his
observations confirmed Schiaparelli&rsquo;s; on the other
hand Niesten at Brussels considered that numerous
drawings of Venus made by himself and
Stuyvaert between 1881 and 1890 harmonised
well with Di Vico&rsquo;s rotation period of 23h. 21m.
22s.; which Trouvelot in 1892 only wished to increase
to about 24 hours.</p>
<p>There is a general consensus of opinion that
great irregularities exist on the surface of Venus.
These are made specially manifest to us in connection
with the terminator or visible edge of the
planet seen as an illuminated crescent. If the
planet had a smooth surface this line would at all
times be a perfect and continuous curve, instead
of which it is frequently to be noticed as a jagged
or broken line. Observations to this effect go
back as far as 1643, when Fontana at Naples observed
this to be the condition of the terminator.
La Hire, Schr&ouml;ter, M&auml;dler, Di Vico and many
others down to the present epoch have noted the
same thing. The fact that the southern horn of
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
Venus is constantly to be seen blunted is so well
established as to admit of no doubt, and this
blunting is commonly ascribed to the existence of a lofty mountain,
to which Schr&ouml;ter ascribed a height of 27 miles. Whatever we
may think as to the precise accuracy of this figure, it seems impossible
to doubt the main fact on which it depends; whilst
a Belgian observer, Van Ertborn, in 1876 repeatedly
saw a point of light in this locality which he
regarded as due to Sun-light impinging on a detached
peak, adjacent valleys remaining in shadow.
This effect is common enough in the case of the
Moon, and is familiar to all who are in the habit
of studying the Moon.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Venus, Dec. 23, 1885.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The existence on Venus of an atmosphere of
considerable density and extent is well established.
Proof of this is to be found in the
marked diminution of the planet&rsquo;s brilliancy
towards the terminator; and in the faint curved
line of light which occasionally may be seen when
the planet is near inferior conjunction. When so
situated, so much of the planet itself as can be
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
seen illuminated shows as a narrow radiant crescent
of light, ending off in two points called indifferently
cusps or horns. It sometimes happens,
however, that from the point of each cusp there
runs round to the other cusp a faint continuation
of the crescent, resulting in the general appearance
of the planet being that of a nearly uniform
ring of light. There is no known way in which the Sun can illuminate
so much more than the half of Venus so as to permit of a perfect circle
being visible except by supposing that an atmosphere exists on the planet and
refracts (or transmits by bending, as it were, round the corner)
a sufficient amount of Sun-light to give rise
to the appearance in question. Further proof of
the existence of an atmosphere on Venus is obtainable
on those very rare occasions when the
planet is seen passing across the disc of the Sun&mdash;a
phenomenon known as a &ldquo;Transit of Venus.&rdquo;
It then nearly always happens that a hazy nebulous
ring of feeble light may be detected encompassing
the planet&rsquo;s disc indicative of course of
the fact that the Sun&rsquo;s rays are there slightly
obstructed in reaching the eye of an observer on
the Earth. Some observers scrutinising Venus
when in transit have thought that they were able
to obtain, by means of the spectroscope, traces of
aqueous vapour on the planet, but the evidence
of this does not appear to be altogether clear or
conclusive.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig10">

<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Everybody may be presumed to be acquainted
with the spectacle popularly known as &ldquo;The Old
Moon in the New Moon&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo; whereby when
the Moon is only about two or three days old and
exhibits but a narrow crescent of bright light, yet
the whole outline of the disc is traceable on the
sky. A phenomenon analogous to this may often
be seen in the case of Venus when near its inferior
conjunction. With the Moon the cause is
due to the reflection of Earth-light (so to speak)
to the Moon, but that explanation seems inadequate
in respect of Venus, because it is conceived
that the amount of Earth-light available is altogether
insufficient for the purpose. Many other
explanations have been put forward including
phosphorescence on the surface of Venus, electrical
displays in the nature of terrestrial auror&aelig;,
and what not, but it must be frankly confessed
that astronomers are all at sea on the subject.</p>
<p>The existence of snow at the poles of Venus
has been suspected by observers of tried skill
and experience such as Phillips and Webb, though
the idea was first broached by Gruithuisen in
1813. Flammarion&rsquo;s observations during 1892
and the two following years are distinctly confirmatory
of this idea. He adds that as both
polar caps are visible at the same time the planet&rsquo;s
axis cannot be much inclined to the plane of
its orbit.</p>
<p>Compared with all the other planets the absolute
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
brightness of Venus stands very high. Of
course it must be understood that by this phrase
&ldquo;absolute brightness&rdquo; no more is meant than its
reflective power. Venus is what it is by virtue of
its power of reflecting Sun-light; presumably it
has no inherent brightness of its own. What its
reflective power is was probably never more
effectively brought under the notice of a human
eye than on September 26, 1878, when Nasmyth
enjoyed an opportunity of seeing Venus and
Mercury side by side for several hours in the
same field of view. He speaks of Venus as resembling
clean silver and Mercury as nothing
better than lead or zinc. Seeing that owing to
its greater proximity to the Sun the light incident
on Mercury must be some 3&frac12; times as strong as
the light incident on Venus, it follows that the
reflective power of Venus must be very great.
As a matter of fact it has been calculated to be
nearly equal to newly fallen snow; in other words
to reflect fully 70 per cent. of the light which
impinges on it.</p>
<p>Venus has no satellite; this fact seems certain.
Yet half a dozen or more observers between 1645
and 1768 discovered such a satellite; observed it;
followed it! This startling mystery, as it really
was, attracted some years ago the attention of a
very careful Belgian observer, Stroobant, who
examined in a most painstaking manner all the
recorded observations. His conclusions were
that in almost all cases particular stars (which he
identified) were mistaken for a satellite. Where
the object seen was not capable of identification,
possibly it was a minor planet; whilst in one instance
it was probable that it was Uranus which
had been seen and regarded as a satellite of Venus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>Venus is perhaps the planet which has most
impressed the popular mind. For the earliest
illustration of this statement we must go as far
back as Homer who makes two references to it
in the <i>Iliad</i>. These, in Pope&rsquo;s version, run as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,</p>
<p class="t0">Far beaming o&rsquo;er the silver host of night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;xxii. 399 [318].</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The morning planet told th&rsquo; approach of light;</p>
<p class="t0">And fast behind, Aurora&rsquo;s warmer ray</p>
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er the broad ocean pour&rsquo;d the golden day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;xxiii. 281 [226].</p>
</div>
<p>The phases of Venus were first discovered by
Galileo and were made known to the world, or
rather to Kepler, in a mystic sentence which has
often been quoted:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>H&aelig;c immatura, a me jam frustra leguntur&mdash;oy.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;These things not ripe; at present [read] in vain [by others] are read by me.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The former sentence transposed becomes&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>Cynthi&aelig; figuras &aelig;mulatur mater amorum.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The mother of loves [Venus] imitates the phases of Cynthia [the Moon].</p>
</div>
<p>Venus revolves round the Sun in 224&frac12; days at
a mean distance of about 67 millions of miles.
Its apparent diameter varies between 9&frac12;&Prime; in superior
conjunction, and 62&Prime; in inferior conjunction.
The real diameter is about 7500 miles; in
other words Venus is nearly as large as the
Earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">THE EARTH.</span></h2>
<p>To us, as its inhabitants, the Earth appeals in
two characters, and in writing a book on astronomy
it is necessary, yet difficult, to keep these
two characters separate. The Earth is an ordinary
planet member of the solar system, amenable
to the same laws, impelled by the same forces,
and going through the same movements as the
other members of the Sun&rsquo;s <i>entourage</i>. Yet, by
reason of the fact that we are ourselves on the
Earth and are not spectators of it looking at it
from at a distance, there are many phenomena
coming under our notice which require special
treatment, and it is often very difficult to say
where the province of the astronomer ends and
that of the geographer begins. This volume
being specially designed to deal with astronomical
matters, I shall pass over many subjects which
may be said to be on the border line, and which
some of my readers may therefore be disappointed
not to find discussed. Besides the geographer,
the geologist and his scientific brother the mineralogist
are concerned with the Earth regarded
as a planet moving through space as the other
planets do. The geologist studies the actual
structure of the Earth, its circumstances and history
so far as they have been revealed to us,
whilst the mineralogist investigates and names
the materials of which it is composed, and classifies
such materials with the assistance of the geologist
on the one hand and of the chemist on the other.
All these subordinate sciences&mdash;subordinate I
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
mean from an astronomer&rsquo;s point of view&mdash;open
up very varied, instructive, and interesting fields
of study, but they are of course foreign to the
purpose of the present volume.</p>
<p>Though the Earth is commonly regarded as a
sphere it is not that in reality, because it is not
of identical dimensions from east to west and
from north to south. It is somewhat flattened
at the poles; its polar diameter is less than its
equatorial diameter, in the ratio of about 298 to
299, or, expressed in miles, its polar diameter is
about 26 miles less than its equatorial diameter.
If a globe 3 feet in diameter be taken to represent
the Earth, then the polar diameter will, on this
scale, be &#8539; inch too long. This flattening of the
poles of the Earth finds its counterpart, so far as we
know, in most, and probably in all of the planets.
It is most considerable and therefore most conspicuous
in the case of Jupiter. It ought here to
be added that a suspicion exists that the equatorial
section of the Earth is not a perfect circle,
but that the diameter of the Earth, taken through
the points on the equator marked by the meridians
13&deg; 58&prime; and 193&deg; 58&prime; east of Greenwich, is one
mile longer than the diameter at right angles to
these two points.</p>
<p>The science which inquires into matters of this
kind, including besides the figure of the Earth,
the length of the degree at different latitudes,
and the distances of places from one another,
alike in angular measure and in time, is called
Geodesy; it is, in point of fact, land-surveying
on a very large scale, in which instruments and
processes of astronomical origin are brought into
operation, and in which astronomers are more or
less required to take the lead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>Although we all of us now perfectly understand
that the Earth is a planet moving round
the Sun as a centre, it is, comparatively speaking,
but recently that this fact has become generally
recognised and understood. It is true that we
can discover here and there in ancient writings
some trace of the idea, yet it is doubtful whether
2000 years ago more than a few &ldquo;advanced&rdquo;
thinkers thoroughly and clearly accepted it as
a distinct truth. It was much more in consonance
with popular thought and the actual appearance
of things that the Earth should be the centre
round which the Sun revolved and on which the
planets depended; and accordingly, sometimes in
one shape and sometimes in another, the notion
of the Earth being the centre of the universe was
generally accepted. The contrary opinion had,
however, a few sympathisers. For instance, Aristarchus
of Samos, who lived in the third century
before the Christian era, supposed, if we may trust
the testimony of Archimedes and Plutarch, that
the Earth revolved round the Sun; this, however,
was regarded as a &ldquo;heresy,&rdquo; in respect of which
he was accused of &ldquo;impiety.&rdquo; Some few years
elapsed and a certain Cleanthes of Assos is said
by Plutarch to have suggested that the great
phenomena of the universe might be explained
by assuming that the Earth was endued with a
motion of translation round the Sun together with
one of rotation on its own axis. The historian
states that this idea was so contrary to the received
opinions that it was proposed to put Cleanthes
on his trial for impiety.</p>
<p>In former times the philosophers who studied
the solar system ranged themselves in several
&ldquo;schools of thought,&rdquo; to use a modern hackneyed
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
phrase. Some upheld the Ptolemaic system,
which took its name from a great Egyptian astronomer,
Claudius Ptolemy, though it does not
appear that he was actually the first to suggest
it. The Ptolemaic system regarded the Earth as
the centre, with the following bodies, all called
planets, revolving round it in the order stated:&mdash;the
Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn. It will be observed that there are
seven bodies here named, and as seven was regarded
as the &ldquo;number of perfection,&rdquo; it was in
later times considered that only these seven
bodies (neither more nor less) could really be the
Earth&rsquo;s celestial attendants. Though Ptolemy
was in one sense an Egyptian, there yet prevailed
amongst the Egyptians at large another theory
slightly different from Ptolemy&rsquo;s. According to
the &ldquo;Egyptian theory,&rdquo; Mercury and Venus were
regarded as satellites of the Sun, and not as primary
planets appurtenant to the Earth.</p>
<p>After Ptolemy&rsquo;s era many centuries elapsed,
during which the whole subject of the solar system
lay practically dormant, and it continued
so until the revival of learning brought new
theorists upon the scene. The most important
of these was Copernicus, who, in the sixteenth
century, propounded a theory which eventually
superseded all others, and, with slight modifications,
is the one now accepted. Copernicus
placed the Sun in the centre of the system, and
treated it as the point around which all the primary
planets revolved. So far, so good; but
Copernicus went astray on the question of the
orbits of the planets. He failed to realise the
true character of the curves which they follow
and treated these curves as &ldquo;epicycles,&rdquo; which
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
word may be described as representing a complicated
combination of little circles which taken
together form a big one. It was left to Kepler
and Newton to settle all such details on a true
and firm basis. But before this stage was
reached a man of the highest astronomical attainments
and practical experience, Tycho Brahe,
made shipwreck of his reputation as an astronomer
by solemnly reviving the idea of the Earth
being the immovable centre of everything. He
treated the Moon as revolving round the Earth
at no great distance and the Sun as doing the
same thing a little farther off; the five planets
revolving round the sun as solar satellites. The
&ldquo;Tychonic system,&rdquo; as it is called, has something
in common with the Ptolemaic system without
being by any means as logical as the latter.
That such far-fetched ideas as Tycho&rsquo;s should
have been palmed off on the world of science so
recently as 300 years ago is passing strange; but
the explanation appears to be that his action
arose out of a misconception of certain passages
of Holy Scripture, which seemed irreconcilable
with the Copernican theory. It must not be
forgotten that Copernicus&rsquo;s famous book, published
in 1543, in which he had announced his
views, had been condemned by the Papal &ldquo;Congregation
of the Index;&rdquo; and therefore Tycho
might have had as a further motive a desire to
curry favour with the authorities of the Church
of Rome, and to gratify his own vanity at the
same time.</p>
<p>With these explanations it will no longer be
misleading if, for convenience sake, I speak of a
certain great circle of the heavens as apparently
traversed by the Sun every year, owing to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
revolution of our Earth round that body. This
circle is called the &ldquo;Ecliptic,&rdquo; and its plane is
usually employed by astronomers as a fixed plane
of reference. It must be distinguished from that
other great circle called the &ldquo;celestial equator,&rdquo;
which is the plane of the Earth&rsquo;s equator extended
towards the stars. The plane of the
equator is inclined to the ecliptic at an angle of
about 23&frac12;&deg;, which angle is known as the &ldquo;obliquity
of the ecliptic.&rdquo; It is this inclination
which gives rise to the seasons which follow one
another in succession during our annual journey
round the Sun. The two points where the celestial
equator and the ecliptic intersect are called
the &ldquo;equinoxes,&rdquo; of spring or autumn as the case
may be; the points midway between these being
the &ldquo;solstices,&rdquo; of summer or winter as the case
may be. These words need but little explanation,
at any rate, as regards those persons who
are able to trace the Latin origin of the words.
&ldquo;Equinox&rdquo; is simply the place occupied by the
Sun twice every year (namely about March 20
and September 22), when day and night are theoretically
equal throughout the world, when also
the sun rises exactly in the east and sets exactly
in the west. The &ldquo;solstices&rdquo; represent the standing
still of the sun at the given times and places,
and are the neutral points where the Sun attains its
greatest northern or southern declination. This
usually occurs about June 21 and December 21.
It must not be forgotten by the way, that the
above application of the words &ldquo;summer&rdquo; and
&ldquo;winter&rdquo; to the solstices is only correct so far as
concerns places in northern terrestrial latitudes&mdash;Europe
and the United States, for instance. In
southern terrestrial latitudes&mdash;for instance, when
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
speaking of what happens at the Cape of Good
Hope and in Australia&mdash;the words must be reversed.</p>
<p>We have seen in a previous chapter that
whilst the orbits of the planets are nearly true
circles, none of them are quite such: and the
departure from the truly circular form results in
some important consequences. Whilst some of
these are too technical to be explained in detail
here, one at least must be referred to because
of what it involves. Not only is the Earth&rsquo;s orbit
eccentric in form, but its eccentricity varies
within narrow limits; and besides this the orbit
itself, as a whole, is subject to a periodical shift
of place, from the joint effect of all which changes
it comes about that our seasons are now of unequal
length, the spring and summer quarters of
the year unitedly extending to 186 days, whilst
the autumn and winter quarters comprise only
178 days. The sun therefore has the chance of
shining for a longer absolute period of time over
the northern hemisphere than over the southern
hemisphere; hence the northern is the warmer
of the two hemispheres, because it has a better,
because a longer, chance of storing up an accumulation
of solar radiant heat. Probably it is one
result of this that the north polar regions of the
Earth are easier of access than the south polar
regions. In the northern hemisphere navigators
have reached to 81&deg; of latitude, whereas 71&deg; is
the highest limit yet attained in the southern
hemisphere. Readers who have studied the history
of explorations in the Arctic regions will not
need to be reminded of the controversy which has
so often arisen respecting the existence or nonexistence
of an &ldquo;Open Polar Sea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>It has already been hinted that it is not an
easy matter to determine, when dealing with the
Earth, where astronomy and its allied sciences,
geography, geodesy and geology respectively,
begin and end. But as certain topics connected
with these sciences, such as the rotundity of the
Earth and its rotation on its axis, will come more
conveniently under consideration in other volumes
of this series, I shall pass them over and
only treat of a few things which more directly
concern the student of nature observing either
with or without the assistance of a telescope.</p>
<p>The fact that the Earth is surrounded by a
considerable atmosphere largely composed of
aqueous vapour has a material bearing on the
success or failure of observations made on the
Earth of bodies situated at a distance. It may
be taken as a general rule that the nearer an
observer is to the surface of the sea, or otherwise
to the surface of the land at the sea-level, the
greater will be the difficulty which will confront
him in carrying on astronomical observations.
Hence such observations are generally made with
unsatisfactory results on the sea coast or on the
banks of rivers. An interesting but rather ancient
illustration of this last-named fact is to be
found in the circumstance that Copernicus, who
died at the age of 70, complained in his last moments
that much as he had tried he had never
succeeded in detecting the planet Mercury, a failure
due, as Gassendi supposed, to the vapours
prevailing near the horizon at the town of Thorn
on the banks of the Vistula where the illustrious
philosopher lived.</p>
<p>The phenomena depending on the presence of
aqueous vapour in the atmosphere which especially
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
under the notice of the astronomer
are Refraction, Twilight, and the Twinkling of
the Stars.</p>
<p>Refraction is what it professes to be, a bending,
and what is bent is the ray of light coming
from a celestial object to a terrestrial station.
Olmsted has put the matter in this way:&mdash;&ldquo;We
must consider that any such object always appears
in the direction in which the <i>last</i> ray of light
comes to the eye. If the light which comes from
a star were bent into fifty directions before it
reached the eye, the star would nevertheless appear
in a line described by the ray nearest the
eye. The operation of this principle is seen when
an oar, or any stick, is thrust into the water. As
the rays of light by which the oar is seen have
their direction changed as they pass out of water
into air, the apparent direction in which the body
is seen is changed in the same degree, giving it a
bent appearance&mdash;the part below the water having
apparently a different direction from the part
above.&rdquo; The direction of this refraction is determined
by the general law of optics that when a
ray of light passes out of a rarer into a denser
medium (for instance out of air into water, or out
of space into the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere) it is bent
<i>towards</i> a perpendicular to the surface of the
medium; but when it passes out of a denser into
a rarer medium it is bent <i>from</i> the perpendicular.
The effect of refraction is to make a heavenly
body appear to have an apparent altitude greater
than its true altitude, so that, for example, an
object situated actually <i>in</i> the horizon will appear
<i>above</i> it. Indeed it sometimes happens that objects
which are actually below the horizon and
which otherwise would be invisible were it not
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
for refraction are thus brought into sight. It
was in consequence of this that on April 20, 1837,
the Moon rose eclipsed before the Sun had set.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Holland thus alludes to the phenomenon:&mdash;&ldquo;I
am tempted to notice a spectacle, having
a certain association with this science, which
I do not remember to have seen recorded either in
prose or poetry, though well meriting description
in either way. This spectacle requires, however,
a combination of circumstances rarely occurring&mdash;a
perfectly clear Eastern and Western horizon,
and an entirely level intervening surface, such as
that of the sea or the African desert&mdash;the former
rendering the illusion, if such it may be called,
most complete to the eye. The view I seek to
describe embraces the orb of the setting Sun,
and that of the full Moon rising in the East&mdash;<i>both
above the horizon at the same time</i>. The spectator
on the sea between, if he can discard from
mental vision the vessel on which he stands, and
regard only these two great globes of Heaven
and the sea-horizon circling unbroken around
him, gains a conception through this spectacle
clearer than any other conjunction can give, of
those wonderful relations which it is the triumph
of astronomy to disclose. All objects are excluded
save the Sun, the Moon, and our own
Globe between, but these objects are such in
themselves that their very simplicity and paucity
of number enhances the sense of the sublime.
Only twice or thrice, however, have I witnessed
the sight in its completeness&mdash;once on a Mediterranean
voyage between Minorca and Sardinia&mdash;once
in crossing the desert from Suez to Cairo,
when the same full Moon showed me, a few hours
later, the very different but picturesque sight of
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
one of the annual caravans of Mecca pilgrims,
with a long train of camels making their night
march towards the Red Sea.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>It is due to the same cause that the Sun and
the Moon when very near the horizon may often
be noticed to exhibit a distorted oval outline.
The fact simply is, that the upper and the lower
limbs undergo a different degree of refraction.
The lower limb being nearer the horizon is more
affected and is consequently raised to a greater
extent than the upper limb, the resulting effect
being that the two limbs are seemingly squeezed
closer together by the difference of the two refractions.
The vertical diameter is compressed
and the circular outline becomes thereby an oval
outline with the lesser axis vertical and the
greater axis horizontal.</p>
<p>Though the foregoing information merely embraces
a few general principles and facts, the
reader will have no difficulty in understanding
that refraction exercises a very inconvenient disturbing
influence on observations which relate to
the exact places of celestial objects. No such
observations are available for mutual comparison,
however great the skill of the observer, or the
perfection of his instrument, unless, and until
certain corrections are applied to the observed
positions in order to neutralise the disturbing
effects of refraction. In practice this is usually
done by means of tables of corrections, those in
most general use being Bessel&rsquo;s. Inasmuch as refraction
depends upon the aqueous vapour in the
atmosphere, its amount at any given moment is
affected by the height of the barometer and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
temperature of the air. Accordingly when, for
any purpose, the utmost precision is required, it
is necessary to take into account the height of
the barometer and the position of the mercury in
the thermometer at the moment in question. At
the zenith there is no refraction whatever, objects
appearing projected on the background of the
sky exactly in the position they would occupy
were the earth altogether destitute of an atmosphere
at all. The amount of the refraction
increases gradually, but in accordance with a
very complex law, from the zenith to the horizon.
Thus the displacement due to refraction which at
the zenith is nothing and at an altitude of 45&deg;
is only 57&Prime; becomes at the horizon more than &frac12;&deg;.
One very curious consequence is involved in the
fact that the displacement due to refraction is at
the horizon what it is; the diameter both of the
Sun and Moon may be said to be &frac12;&deg;, more or
less, so that when we see the lower edge of either
of these luminaries just <i>touching</i> the horizon <i>in
reality</i> the whole disc is completely <i>below</i> it, and
would be altogether hidden by the convexity of
the earth were it not for the existence of the
earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and the consequent refraction
of the rays of light passing through it from the
Sun (or Moon) to the observer.</p>
<p>Twilight is another phenomenon associated
with astronomical principles and effects which depends
in some degree on the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere
and on the laws which regulate the reflection
and refraction of light. After the Sun has set it
continues to illuminate the clouds and upper
strata of the air just as it may often be seen
shining on the tops of hills long after it has disappeared
from the view of the inhabitants of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
plains below, and indeed may illuminate the
chimneys of a house when it is no longer visible
to a person standing in the garden below. The
air and clouds thus illuminated reflect some of
the Sun&rsquo;s light to the surface of the earth lying
immediately underneath, and thus produce after
sun-set and before sun-rise, in a degree more or less
considerable according as the Sun is only a little
or is much depressed below the horizon, that luminous
glow which we call &ldquo;twilight.&rdquo; This word is
of Saxon origin and implies the presence of a twin,
or double, light. As soon as the Sun has disappeared
below the horizon all the clouds overhead
continue for a few minutes so highly illuminated
as to reflect scarcely less light than the direct
light of the Sun. As, however, the Sun gradually
sinks lower and lower, less and less of the
visible atmosphere receives any portion of its
light, and consequently less and less is reflected
minute by minute to the Earth at the observer&rsquo;s
station until at length the time comes when there
is no sunlight to be reflected&mdash;and it is night.
The converse of all this happens before and up
to sun-rise; night ceases, twilight ensues, gradually
becoming more definite; the dawn appears,
and finally the full Sun bursts forth. It may here
be stated as a note by the way that the circumstances
under which the Sun first shows itself
after it has risen above the horizon has some
bearing on the probable character of the weather
which is at hand. When the first indications of
day-light are seen above a bank of clouds it is
thought to be a sign of wind; but if the first
streaks of light are discovered low down, that is
in, or very near the horizon, fair weather may be
expected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>Twilight is usually reckoned to last until the
Sun has sunk 18&deg; below the horizon, but the
question of its duration depends on where the
observer is stationed, on the season of the year,
and (in a slight degree) on the condition of the
atmosphere. The general rule is that the twilight
is least in the tropics and increases as the observer
moves away from the equator towards
either pole. Whilst in the tropics a depression
of 16&deg; or 17&deg; is sufficient to put an end to the
phenomenon, in the latitude of England a depression
of from 17&deg; to 20&deg; is required. As implied
above, it varies with the latitude; and as
regards the different seasons of the year, it is
least on March 1 and October 12, being three
weeks before the vernal equinox and three weeks
after the autumnal equinox. The duration at
the equator may be about 1 hour 12 minutes;
it amounts to nearly 2 hours at the latitude of
Greenwich, and so on towards the pole. At
each pole in turn the Sun is below the horizon
for 6 months, but as it is less than 18&deg; below
the horizon for about 3&frac12; of those 6 months it
may be said that there is a continual twilight for
those 3&frac12; months. Something of the same sort
of thing as this occurs in the latitude of Greenwich,
for there is no true night at Greenwich
from May 22 to July 21, but constant twilight
from sunset to sunrise, or 2 months of twilight
in all. Though twilight at the equator is commonly
set down as lasting about an hour, this
period is there, as elsewhere, affected by the
elevation of the observer above the sea-level.
Where the air is very rarified, as at places situated
as Quito and Lima are, the twilight is said
to last no more than 20 minutes, and this would
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
accord with the theory that where there is no air
at all (<i>e.g.</i>, on the Moon) there is no twilight at
all. The greater purity and clearness of mountain
air, rarified as it is, is another cause which
contributes to vary by reducing the duration of
twilight.</p>
<p>It is sometimes stated that a secondary twilight
may be noticed, and Sir John Herschel has spoken
of it as &ldquo;consequent on a re-reflection of the rays
dispersed through the atmosphere in the primary
one. The phenomenon seen in the clear atmosphere
of the Nubian Desert, described by travellers
under the name of the &lsquo;afterglow,&rsquo; would
seem to arise from this cause.&rdquo; I am not acquainted
with any records which throw light on
these remarks of Sir John Herschel.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of twinkling is a subject
which has been much neglected, possibly on account
of its apparent, but only apparent, simplicity.
The familiar verse of our days of childhood&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Twinkle, twinkle little star,</p>
<p class="t0">How I wonder what you are,</p>
<p class="t0">Up above the earth so high,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a diamond in the sky,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>contains even in this simple form a good deal of
food for reflection; whilst the new version&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Twinkle, twinkle little star,</p>
<p class="t0">Now we&rsquo;ve found out what you are,</p>
<p class="t0">When unto the midnight sky</p>
<p class="t0">We the spectroscope apply,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>does so yet more.</p>
<p>As an optical phenomenon the twinkling, or to
use the more scientific phrase, the scintillation,
of the stars is a matter which has been strangely
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
ignored by physicists. Indeed, the only investigators
who seem to have dealt with it in any sort
of detail are two Italians, Secchi and Respighi,
Dufour, a Frenchman, Montigny, a Belgian, and
the Rev. E. Ledger, an Englishman. Secchi has
truly remarked that the twinkling of the stars is
one of the most beautiful of the minor phenomena
of the heavens. Light, sometimes bright, sometimes
feeble, sometimes white, sometimes red,
darts about in intermittent gleams, like the sparkling
flashes of a well-cut diamond, and works upon
the feelings of even the most stolid spectator.
The theory of twinkling is still surrounded by
many difficulties. One thing, however, is certain&mdash;it
has nothing to do with recurrent changes in
the intrinsic light or physical condition of the
star itself, but arises during the passage of its
rays through our atmosphere; it depends, therefore,
in some way or other on the varying conditions
of the atmosphere. On the summit of
high mountains, according to the observations
of all careful observers (notably Tacchini, who
studied the subject on Mount Etna), the light of
the stars is steady, like that of the planets; and
it is so likewise during the hours of calm which
often precede terrestrial storms. The vibrations
are usually more frequent near the horizon, and
diminish with the elevation of the star above the
horizon; in other words, with the lessening of
the thickness of the atmospheric strata which
the rays of light have to traverse. Nevertheless,
during windy weather, and specially with northerly
wind, it may be noticed that the stars
twinkle high up above the horizon, and even as
far as the zenith. From these and other similar
considerations we are justified in drawing the
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
conclusion that twinkling largely depends on the
condition and movements of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Secchi further points out that it is impossible
to study carefully with the naked eye all the
features of twinkling, and that telescopic assistance
is imperatively necessary. When, with the
aid of a telescope, we scrutinise a star during a
disturbed evening marked by much twinkling we
see an image diffused and undefined and surrounded
by rays, as if several images were superposed,
and were jumping about rapidly. On such
occasions we do not see that little defined disc
surrounded by motionless diffraction rings, ordinarily
indicative of a tranquil atmosphere. With
a telescope armed with a medium power, the field
of view of which is more extensive than that of a
high power, we find that if a light tap is given
to the telescope, the ordinary simple image is
changed into a luminous curve, the perimeter of
which is formed entirely of a succession of arcs
exhibiting the colours of the rainbow. This coloured
curve does not, in principle, differ from
what one sees on swinging round and round in
the air such a thing as a stick, the end of which
is alight, having been freshly taken from a fire.
The glowing tip produces in appearance a continuous
arc, the result of the persistence of the image
of the tip on the retina. In such a case the
colour is constant, because the illumination resulting
from the blazing wood does not vary; but
in the case of a star the arcs are differently coloured
during the very brief space of time in which
the vibrating telescope transports the image from
one side to another of the visible field. This experiment
is from its nature very crude, but the
idea was improved upon and reduced to a systematic
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
shape by Montigny, who introduced into
his telescope, at a certain distance from the eyepiece,
a concave lens eccentrically placed with
respect to the axis of the instrument, and endued
with a rapid movement of rotation imparted by
suitable mechanism. He thus obtained images
which revolved with regularity, and so was able
to submit certain features of the phenomenon to
a definite system of measurement. To cut a long
story short, Montigny started with the assumption
(made good by the sequel) that possibly stars
were affected in their twinkling by intrinsic constitutional
differences; and that possibly Secchi&rsquo;s
classification of stars into four types (a classification
which depends on the spectra which they
yield) might put him on the track of some intelligible
conclusions with respect to the theory of
twinkling.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The results he ultimately arrived at were, that
the yellow and red stars of the IInd and IIIrd
types twinkle less rapidly than the white stars
of the Ist type. Whilst the average number of
scintillations per second of the stars of type III.
were 56, those of type II. were 69, and those of
type I. 86. These differences may be confidently
said to depend upon too many observations of
too many different stars to be fortuitous. Montigny
also arrived at a number of incidental conclusions
of considerable interest. The one main
thread running through them, is that there is a
connection between the twinkling of a star and
its spectrum, which had never before been thought
of. We are justified, indeed, in going so far as to
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
say, that Montigny&rsquo;s observations point distinctly
to a law on this subject, the law being that the
more the spectrum of a star is interrupted by dark
lines, the less frequent are its scintillations. The
individual character of the light, therefore, emitted
by any given star appears to affect its twinkling,
both as regards the frequency thereof and the colours
displayed.</p>
<p>Montigny collected some other interesting
facts with reference to twinkling, which may here
be stated in a concise form. There is a greater
display of twinkling in showery weather, than when
the atmosphere is in a normal condition; and in
winter than in summer, whatever may be the
weather. In dry weather in Spring and Autumn
the twinkling is about the same, but wet has
more effect in Autumn than in Spring in developing
the phenomenon. Variations in the barometric
pressure and in the humidity of the air
also affect the amount of twinkling; there is
more before a rainy period, likely to last 2 or 3
days, than before a single, or, so to speak, casual
rainy day. Twinkling also varies with the aggregate
total rain-fall of any group of days, being
more pronounced as the rain-fall is greater, but
decreasing suddenly and considerably as soon as
the rainy condition of the atmosphere has passed
away. The number of scintillations found to be
observable with the aid of Montigny&rsquo;s instrument
(which he called a &ldquo;<i>scintillom&egrave;tre</i>&rdquo;), varied from a
minimum of 50 during June and July, to 97 in
January, and 101 in February, increasing and
decreasing in regular sequence from month to
month. When an Aurora Borealis is visible, there
is a marked increase in the amount of twinkling.
It would be interesting to follow up this last
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
named discovery by an endeavour to ascertain
whether the fluctuations which are coincident in
point of time with an Auroral display depend
upon optical considerations connected with the
Aurora, or on physical considerations having any
relation to the increased development of terrestrial
magnetism.</p>
<p>I have been thus particular in unfolding somewhat
fully the present state of our knowledge
concerning the twinkling of the stars, because it
is evident that there are many interesting points
connected with it, which may be studied by any
patient and attentive star-gazer, and which do not
need the instrumental appliances and technical refinements
which are only to be found in fully-equipped
public and private observatories.</p>
<p>It should be mentioned in conclusion that the
planets twinkle very little, or, more often, not at
all. This is mainly due to the fact that they exhibit
discs of sensible diameter and therefore that
there is, as Young puts it, &ldquo;a general unchanging
average of brightness for the sum total of all the
luminous points of which the disc is composed.
When, for instance, point A of the disc becomes
dark for a moment, point B, very near to it, is
just as likely to become bright; the interference
conditions being different for the 2 points. The
different points of the disc <i>do not keep step</i>, so to
speak, in their twinkling.&rdquo; The non-twinkling of
planets because they possess sensible discs is
often available as a means for determining when
a planet is looked for, which, of several objects
looked at, is the planet wanted and which are
merely stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE MOON.</span></h2>
<p>The Moon being merely the satellite of a
planet, to wit, the Earth, it should, according to
the plan of this book, be included in the chapter
which deals with its primary; but for us inhabitants
of the Earth the Moon has so many special
features of interest that it will be better to give
it a special chapter to itself.</p>
<p>We may regard the Moon in a twofold aspect,
and consider what it is as a mere object to look
at, and what it does for us; probably my present
readers will prefer that most prominence shall be
given to the former aspect. The Moon as seen
with the naked eye exhibits a silvery mass of light,
which at the epoch of what is called &ldquo;full Moon&rdquo;
has a seemingly even circular outline. Full or not
full, its surface appears to be irregularly shaded
or mottled. The immediate cause of this shading
is the fact that the surface of the Moon, not being
really smooth, reflects irregularly the Sun&rsquo;s light
which falls upon it. The <i>causa causans</i> of this is
the existence of numerous mountains and valleys
on its surface, and which were first discovered to
be such by Galileo. That there are mountains is
proved by the shadows cast by their peaks on the
surrounding plains, when the Sun illuminates the
Moon obliquely&mdash;that is, when the Moon is shining
either as a crescent or gibbous. Such shadows,
however, disappear at the phase of &ldquo;Full-Moon,&rdquo;
because the Sun&rsquo;s rays then fall perpendicularly
on the Moon&rsquo;s surface. When the Moon presents
either a crescent or a gibbous form (in point of
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
fact when it presents any form except that of
&ldquo;Full-Moon&rdquo;), the boundary line which separates
the illuminated from the unilluminated portion
(and which boundary line is generally spoken of as the &ldquo;terminator&rdquo;)
has a rough, jagged appearance; this is due to the fact that the Sun&rsquo;s light
falls first on the summits of the peaks, and that the adjacent valleys
and declivities are in shade. These remain so till by reason of
the Moon&rsquo;s progress in its orbit a sufficient time
has elapsed for the Sun to penetrate to the bottom
of the valleys. With this explanation the
reader will have no difficulty in realising why the
terminator always exhibits an irregular or jagged
edge.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="Fig. 11.&mdash;Mare Crisium. (Lick Observatory photographs.)" width="500" height="493" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Mare Crisium. (Lick Observatory photographs.)</span></p>
</div>
<p>Various mountains on the Moon to the number
of more than a thousand have been mapped,
and their elevations calculated. Of these fully
half have received names, being those of men of
various dates and nationalities, who have figured
conspicuously in the annals of science, including
some, however, who have not done so. Whilst
many of these mountains are isolated elevations,
not a few form definite chains of mountains, and
to certain of these chains definite names, borrowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
from the Earth, have been given. Thus
we find on maps of the Moon the &ldquo;Apennines,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Alps,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Altai Mountains,&rdquo; the &ldquo;D&ouml;rfel
Mountains,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Caucasus Mountains,&rdquo; and
so on.</p>
<p>Besides the mountains there exist on the Moon
a number of plains analogous in some sense to
the &ldquo;steppes&rdquo; of Asia and the &ldquo;prairies&rdquo; of
North America. These were termed &ldquo;seas&rdquo; in
the early days of the telescope, because it was
assumed that as they were so large and so smooth
they were vast tracts of water. This supposition
has long ago been overthrown, but the names
have been retained as a matter of convenience.
Hence it comes about that in descriptions of the
Moon one meets with such names as <i>Mare Imbrium</i>,
the &ldquo;Sea of Showers&rdquo;; <i>Mare Serenitatis</i>, the &ldquo;Sea
of Serenity&rdquo;; <i>Mare Tranquillitatis</i>, the &ldquo;Sea of
Tranquillity&rdquo;; and so on. It seems probable
that the so-called seas represent in nearly its
original form what was once the original surface
of the Moon before the mountains were formed.
A confirmation of this idea is to be found in the
fact that though these plains are fairly level surfaces
compared with the masses of mountains
which hedge them in on all sides, yet the plains
themselves are dotted over with inequalities (small
elevations and pits), which seem to suggest that
some of them might eventually have developed
into mountains if the further formation of mountains
had not been arrested by the fiat of the
Creator.</p>
<p>Though hitherto we have been speaking of
the mountains of the Moon under that generic
title, it is necessary for the reader to understand
that the Moon&rsquo;s surface exhibits everywhere remarkable
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
illustrations of those geological processes
which we on the earth associate with the
word &ldquo;volcano.&rdquo; There cannot be the least doubt
that the existing surface of the Moon, as we see
it, owes all its striking features to volcanic action,
differing little from the volcanic action to
which we are accustomed on the earth. That
this theory is well founded may be very easily
inferred by comparing the structural details of
certain terrestrial volcanoes and their surroundings
with a typical lunar mountain, or indeed, I
might say, with any lunar mountain. This point
was very well worked out some 40 years ago by
Professor Piazzi Smyth, who placed on pictorial
record his results of an examination and survey
of the Peak of Teneriffe. Any person seeing
side by side one of Smyth&rsquo;s pictures of Teneriffe
and a picture of any average lunar crater would
find great difficulty if the pictures were not labelled
in determining which was which.</p>
<p>The one special feature of the Moon, which
never fails to attract the attention of everybody
who looks at our satellite for the first time
through a telescope, are the crater mountains,
which indeed constitute an immense majority of
all the lunar mountains. Their outline almost
always conforms, more or less, to that of the
circle, but when seen near either limb of the
Moon they often appear considerably oval simply
because they are then seen considerably foreshortened.
In their normal form they exhibit a
basin bounded by a ridge, with a conical elevation
in the centre of the basin, the basin and the
cone together being evidently the result of an
uprush of gases breaking through the outer crust
of the Moon and carrying with them masses of
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
molten lava. This lava, with perhaps the materials
in fragments, projected in the first instance
up into the air, fell back on to the Moon forming
first of all the outer edge of the basin, and subsequently,
as the eruptive force became weakened,
the small central accumulation, which took, as it
naturally would do, a conical shape. An experimental
imitation of the process thus inferred was
carried out some years ago by a French physicist,
Bergeron, who acted upon a very fusible mixture
of metals known as Wood&rsquo;s alloy by forcing
through it a current of hot air. The success of
this experiment was complete, and Bergeron considered
that his experiments, taken as a whole,
were calculated to throw much light on the past
history of the Moon.</p>
<p>Several observers at various times have fancied
they have seen signs that the lunar mountain
Aristarchus was an active volcano even up to the
present century; but it admits of no doubt that
this idea is altogether a misconception, and that
what they saw as a faint illumination of the summit
of Aristarchus was no more than an effect of
earth-shine. On the general question of volcanic
action on the Moon, Sir John Herschel summed
up as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Decisive marks of volcanic
stratification arising from successive deposits of
ejected matter, and evident indications of lava
currents, streaming outwards in all directions,
may be clearly traced with powerful telescopes.
In Lord Rosse&rsquo;s magnificent Reflector the flat
bottom of the crater called Albategnius is seen to
be strewed with blocks not visible in inferior
telescopes, while the exterior ridge of another
(Aristillus) is all hatched over with deep gulleys
radiating towards its centre.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The valleys and clefts or rills visible on the
Moon&rsquo;s surface constitute another remarkable
feature in the topography of our satellite. The
valleys, properly so-called, require no particular
comment, because they are just what their name
implies&mdash;hollows often many miles long and
several miles wide. The clefts or rills, however,
are more mysterious, by reason of their great
length and remarkable narrowness. One is almost
led to infer that they are naught else but
cracks in the lunar crust, the result of sudden
cooling, how caused is of course not known.</p>
<p>There is another lunar feature to be mentioned
somewhat akin to the foregoing in appearance
but apparently, however, owing its origin to a
different cause. I refer to the systems of bright
streaks which, especially at or near the time of
full Moon, are seen to radiate from several of
the largest craters, and in particular from Tycho,
Copernicus, Kepler and Aristarchus. These bright
streaks extend in many cases far beyond what
may fairly be considered as the neighbourhood
of the craters from which they start, traversing
distant mountains, valleys and other craters in a
way which renders it very difficult to assign an
explanation of their origin.</p>
<p>There are 13 areas on the Moon, which used
to be regarded as &ldquo;seas,&rdquo; one of them, however,
bearing the name of &ldquo;<i>Oceanus Procellarum</i>,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Ocean of Storms&rdquo;; but besides these there are
several bays, termed in Latin <i>Sinus</i>, of which the
most important is the <i>Sinus Iridum</i> or the &ldquo;Bay
of Rainbows,&rdquo; a beautiful spot on the northern
border of the <i>Mare Imbrium</i>, and best seen when
the Moon is between 9 and 10 days old. The
summits of the semi-circular range of rocks
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
which enclose the bay are then strongly illuminated
and a greenish shadow marks the valley at
its base. By the way, it is worth mentioning
that not a few of the lunar seas, so-called, seem
to be pervaded by a greenish hue, though no
particular explanation of this fact is forthcoming.</p>
<p>Much controversy has ranged round the question
whether or not the Moon has an atmosphere.
Without doubt the preponderance of opinion is
on the negative side, though it must be admitted
that some observers of eminence have suggested
that there are indeed traces of an atmosphere to
be had, but that it is extremely attenuated and
of no great extent, otherwise it must render
its presence discoverable by optical phenomena
which it is certain cannot be detected.</p>
<p>A brief reference may here be made to a curious
phenomenon sometimes seen in connection
with occultations of stars by the Moon. Premising
that an &ldquo;occultation&rdquo; is the disappearance of
a star behind the solid body of the Moon by reason
of the forward movement of the Moon in her
orbit, it must be stated that though generally the
Moon extinguishes the star&rsquo;s light instantaneously,
yet this does not invariably happen, for
sometimes the star seems to hang upon the
Moon&rsquo;s limb as if reluctant to disappear. No
very clear or satisfactory explanation of this
phenomenon has yet been given; the existence
of a lunar atmosphere would be an explanation,
and accordingly this anomalous appearance, seen
on occasions, has been advanced in support of
the theory that a lunar atmosphere does exist;
but, nevertheless, astronomers do not accept that
idea.</p>
<p>Any one desirous of carrying out a careful
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
study of the Moon&rsquo;s surface must be provided
with a good map, and for general purposes none
is so convenient or accessible as Webb&rsquo;s, reduced
from Beer and M&auml;dler&rsquo;s <i>Mappa Selenographica</i>
published in 1837, of which another reproduction
is given in Lardner&rsquo;s <i>Astronomy</i>. Those, however,
who would desire to study the Moon with the utmost
attention to detail must provide themselves
with Schmidt&rsquo;s map published in 1878 at the
expense of the German Government. When it is
stated that this map represents the Moon on a
circle 7&frac12; feet in diameter, the size and amount of
detail in it will be readily understood. Special
books on the Moon furnishing numerous engravings
and detailed descriptions have been written
by Carpenter and Nasmyth (jointly) and by
Neison.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to determine
the amount of light reflected by the Moon,
and also the question whether it yields any measurable
amount of heat. As regards the light of
the full Moon compared with that of the Sun, the
estimates range from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>300000</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>800000</sub>, a discrepancy
not perhaps greater than might be expected
under the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p>With respect to the heat possessed by, or
radiated from the Moon&rsquo;s surface, the conclusions
of those who have attempted to deal with
the matter are less consistent. As regards the
surface of the Moon itself Sir John Herschel was
of opinion that it is heated at least to the temperature
of boiling water, but that owing to the
radiant heat having to pass through our atmosphere,
which acts as an obstacle, it is no wonder
that it should be difficult for us to become conscious
of its existence. In 1846 Melloni, by concentrating
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
the rays of the Moon with a lens 3
feet in diameter, thought he detected a sensible
elevation of temperature; and in 1856 C. P.
Smyth at Teneriffe, but with inferior instrumental
appliances, arrived at the same conclusion.
Though Professor Tyndall in 1861 obtained
a contrary result, yet the most recent experiments
by the younger Earl of Rosse, Professor
Langley, and others, all tend to show that the Moon
does really radiate a certain infinitesimally small
amount of heat. Perhaps, however, it will be
best to give Langley&rsquo;s ideas as to this in his own
words:&mdash;&ldquo;While we have found abundant evidence
of heat from the Moon, every method we
have tried, or that has been tried by others, for
determining the character of this heat appears to
us inconclusive; and without questioning that
the Moon radiates heat earthward from its soil,
we have not yet found any experimental means
of discriminating with such certainty between
this and reflected heat that it is not open to misinterpretation.&rdquo;
It is obvious from the foregoing
that we on the Earth need not concern ourselves
very much about lunar heat; and I will only add
that F. W. Very, by an ingenious endeavour to
localise the Moon&rsquo;s radiant heat, has been able,
he thinks, to establish the fact that on the part
of the Moon to which the Sun is setting, what he
calls the heat-gradient (using a phrase suggested
by terrestrial meteorology) appears to be steeper
than on that part to which the Sun is rising. Generally,
Very&rsquo;s observations accord fairly with Lord
Rosse&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Moon revolves round the Earth in 27 d.
7 h. 43 m. 11 s. at a mean distance of 237,300
miles, in an orbit which is somewhat, but not
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
very, eccentric. Its angular diameter at mean
distance is 31&prime; 5&Prime;, or, say, just over &frac12;&deg;. The real
diameter may be called 2160 miles.</p>
<p>A few words will probably be expected by the
reader on the subject of lunar influences on the
weather, and generally; this being a matter highly
attractive to the popular mind. The truth appears
to lie, as usual, between two extremes of
thought. The Moon, of course, is the main cause
of the tides of the Ocean, and it is not entirely
inconceivable that tidal changes imparted to vast
masses of water may be either synchronous with,
or may in some way engender, analogous movements
in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere; though no distinct
proofs of this, as a determinate fact, can be
brought forward.</p>
<p>There is no doubt whatever that at or near
the time of full Moon, evening clouds tend to disperse
as the Moon comes up to the meridian,
and that by the time the Moon has reached the
meridian a sky previously overcast will have become
almost or quite clear. Sir John Herschel
has alluded to this by speaking of a &ldquo;tendency to
disappearance of clouds under a full Moon&rdquo;;
and he considers this &ldquo;fully entitled to rank as a
meteorological fact.&rdquo; He goes on, not unnaturally,
to suggest the obvious thought that such
dissipation of terrestrial clouds is due to the circumstance
that, assuming heat really comes by
radiation from the Moon (and we have seen on a
previous page the probability of this) such radiant
heat will be more potential if it falls on the
Earth perpendicularly, as from a Meridian Moon,
than if it comes to us at any one locality from a
Moon low down in the observer&rsquo;s horizon, and
therefore has to pass through the denser strata
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
of the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere and suffer material
enfeeblement accordingly. I am aware that Mr.
Ellis, late of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
has sought to show by a seemingly powerful
array of statistics that the idea now under consideration
is unfounded, but I consider that we
have here only one more illustration of the familiar
statement that you can prove anything
you like by statistics. I am firmly convinced, as
the result of more than 30 years&rsquo; observation,
that terrestrial clouds do disperse under the circumstances
stated. Sir J. Herschel added that
his statement proceeded from his own observation
&ldquo;made quite independently of any knowledge
of such a tendency having been observed by
others. Humboldt, however, in his <i>Personal Narrative</i>,
speaks of it as well known to the pilots
and seamen of Spanish America.&rdquo; Sir John Herschel
further remarked:&mdash;&ldquo;Arago has shown from
a comparison of rain, registered as having fallen
during a long period, that a slight preponderance
in respect of quantity falls near the &lsquo;new&rsquo; Moon
over that which falls near the &lsquo;full.&rsquo; This would
be a natural and necessary consequence of a preponderance
of a cloudless sky about the &lsquo;full,&rsquo;
and forms, therefore, part and parcel of the same
meteorological fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernadin has asserted it to be a fact that many
thunderstorms occur about the period of &ldquo;new&rdquo;
or &ldquo;full&rdquo; Moon. But what I want most to warn
the reader against is that popular idea (wonderfully
wide-spread it must be admitted) that at the
epochs of what are called, most illogically, the
Moon&rsquo;s &ldquo;changes,&rdquo; changes of weather may certainly
be expected. There is absolutely no
foundation whatever for this, and still more void
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
of authority (if such a phrase is admissible) is a
table of imaginary weather to be expected at
changes of the Moon, often met with in books
published half a century ago, and still occasionally
reprinted in third-rate almanacs, and designated
&ldquo;Dr. Herschel&rsquo;s Weather Table.&rdquo; This
precious production is not only devoid of authenticity
as regards its name, but may easily be seen
to be fraudulent in its reputed facts any month in
the year.</p>
<p>It would be beyond both my present available
space and the legitimate objects of this work to
attempt even an outline of the influences over
things terrestrial ascribed to, or associated, rightly
or wrongly, with the Moon, and of which the
word &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo; perhaps affords the most familiar
exponent.</p>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">MARS.</span></h2>
<p>Mars, though considerably smaller than the
Earth, is commonly regarded as the planet which,
taken all in all, bears most resemblance to the
Earth, though only one-fourth its size. Under
circumstances which have already been briefly
alluded to in Chapter I., Mars exhibits from time
to time a slight phase, but nothing approaching
in amount the phases presented by the two inferior
planets, Mercury and Venus. When in opposition
to the Sun, that is to say when on the
meridian at midnight, it has a truly circular disc;
but between opposition and its two positions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
quadrature it is gibbous. At the minimum phase,
which is at each quadrature, E. or W. as the case
may be, the planet resembles the Moon 3 days
from its &ldquo;full.&rdquo; These phases are an indication
that Mars shines by the reflected light of the Sun.
It is a remarkable tribute to Galileo&rsquo;s powers of
observation that with his trumpery telescope,
only a few inches long, he should have been able
to suspect the existence of a Martial phase.
Writing to a friend in 1610 he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I dare not
affirm that I can observe the phases of Mars;
however, if I mistake not, I think I already perceive
that he is not perfectly round.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Four views of Mars differing 90&deg; in longitude (Barnard).</span></p>
</div>
<p>The period in which Mars performs its journey
round the Sun (called the sidereal period) is about
687 days; but owing to the Earth&rsquo;s motion we
are more concerned with what is called the
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
planet&rsquo;s synodical period of 780 days than with
its sidereal period of 687 days. The synodical
period is the interval between two successive conjunctions
or oppositions of the planet as regards
the Earth, and 780 days being twice 365 and 50
days over, it follows that we have an opportunity
of seeing the planet at its best about every 2
years; and this is one of the reasons why Mars
has been so much and so thoroughly studied as
regards its physical appearance. Of course Mars
is not equally well seen every 2 years, because it
may so happen at a given opposition that it may
be at its nearest to the Sun (perihelion), and the
Earth at its farthest from the Sun (aphelion), in
which case the actual distance between the two
bodies will be the greatest possible. What is
therefore wanted is for the planet to be nearest
to the Sun and nearest to the Earth at the same
time, under which circumstances it shines with a
brilliancy rivalling Jupiter. This favourable combination
occurs once in 7 synodical revolutions,
or about every 15 years. The most favourable
oppositions occur at the end of August, and the
least favourable at the end of February. The next
very favourable opposition will not occur until
1909. Mars may approach to within about 35
millions of miles from the Earth at a favourable
opposition, whilst under extreme circumstances
the other way it may be no nearer than 61 millions
of miles at opposition.</p>
<p>Mars in opposition is a very conspicuous object
in the Heavens, shining with a fiery red light
which has always been regarded as a peculiar
attribute of the planet, so much so that its name,
or epithet, in many languages conveys the idea
of &ldquo;fiery&rdquo; or &ldquo;blazing.&rdquo; It is recorded that in
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
August 1719 its brilliancy was such as to cause
a panic amongst the public.</p>
<p>Telescopically examined, Mars is always found
to exhibit patches of shade of various sizes and
shapes, and, on the whole, fairly permanent from
year to year. During the last few years in particular
these markings have been subjected to
very careful scrutiny and measurement at the
hands of numerous observers of skill and experience,
and armed in many cases with very powerful
telescopes. The conjoint effect of the observations
obtained has been largely to augment
our knowledge of the planet&rsquo;s geography, or (to
use the proper term) &ldquo;areography.&rdquo; Before describing
the minutest details recorded and pencilled
by the best observers, it will be best to
speak of the leading general features which are
within the grasp of comparatively small telescopes&mdash;say,
refractors of 6 inches and reflectors of 12
inches in aperture. The first thing which presents
itself as very obvious on the disc of Mars,
is the fact that certain portions are ruddy, whilst
others are greenish in hue. It is generally assumed
that the red areas represent land and the
green areas water. On this subject Sir John
Herschel&rsquo;s remarks, penned about half a century
ago, may be said still to stand good. He ascribes
the ruddy colour to &ldquo;an ochrey tinge in the general
soil, like what the red sandstone districts
on the Earth may possibly offer to the inhabitants
of Mars, only more decided.&rdquo; The propriety
of this thought will be best appreciated
by a reader who has travelled through parts of
North Gloucestershire, and seen a succession of
ploughed fields in that locality. The deep red
colour of the soil is in many places very conspicuous.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
It has often been remarked that the
redness of Mars is much more noticeable with the
naked eye than with a telescope; and Arago carried
this idea one step further in suggesting that
the higher the optical power the less the colour.
This, however, might naturally be expected.</p>
<p>The most prominent surface marking on Mars
is that known as the &ldquo;Kaiser Sea,&rdquo; sometimes
called the &ldquo;V-mark&rdquo; from its resemblance to
that letter, though a leg of mutton would be
quite as good a simile. East of the Kaiser Sea
and a little north of the planet&rsquo;s equator is a
well-defined dark streak known as &ldquo;Herschel
II. Strait&rdquo;; whilst on the west side is another
shaded area which has been called &ldquo;Flammarion
Sea.&rdquo; These three features are so very conspicuous,
that, provided the hemisphere in which they
are situated is fairly in front of the observer,
his telescope, if it will show anything on Mars,
will show these. The white patches seen on
certain occasions <i>at</i> Mars&rsquo;s N. pole and <i>close to</i> its
S. pole form another special feature of interest
connected with this planet. It admits of no
doubt whatever that these are immense masses
of snow and ice which undergo at stated intervals
changes analogous to the changes which we know
happen in the great fields of ice situated in the
regions of the Earth surrounding the Earth&rsquo;s two
poles. Not only do these white patches look
like snow, but if attention is paid to the changes
they undergo and the epochs at which the changes
take place there will be found abundant confirmation
of this theory, for these patches decrease
in size when brought under the Sun&rsquo;s influence
on the approach of summer and increase again in
size when the summer is over and winter draws
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
near. In the second half of 1892 the Southern
Pole was in full view, and during especially July
and August the diminution of the snow area from
week to week was very evident. Schiaparelli,
who observed it with great attention during that
season, noted at the commencement of the season
that the snow reached at the first as far as latitude
70&deg; and formed a polar cap some 1200 miles
in diameter. Its subsequent decrease, however,
was so marked that two or three months later the
diameter of the snow patch had dwindled to no
more than 180 miles, and became indeed still
smaller at a later period. The summer solstice
on Mars occurred on October 13, 1892, which was
therefore the epoch of midsummer for Mars&rsquo;s
southern hemisphere. Whilst these changes were
taking place in the southern hemisphere, no doubt
changes of the reverse character were going on in
the northern hemisphere, but they were not visible
from the Earth because the North Pole was
situated in that hemisphere of Mars which was
turned away from the Earth. In previous years,
however, the North Pole being turned towards the
Earth its snow was also seen to undergo the same
sort of change; in other words, was seen to melt.
This happened, and was seen in 1882, 1884, and
1886. These observations of the alternate increase
and decrease of the polar snow on Mars
may be viewed with telescopes of moderate power,
but of course it is more interesting and profitable
to watch them with a large telescope. The fact
(for it is an undoubted fact) that the north polar
snow is concentric with the planet&rsquo;s axis whilst
the southern polar patch is eccentric to the extent
of about 180 miles from the southern pole is one
which has not yet received a satisfactory explanation.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
If both patches were eccentric so as to be
exactly opposite to one another an explanation
would be much more easy for we might say that
the poles of rotation lay in one direction and the
poles of cold in another.</p>
<p>I have spoken on a previous page of three
specially conspicuous shadings of Mars, and other
similar shadings to the number perhaps of a
couple of dozen were generally recognised by
astronomers (having been mapped and named)
down to about the year 1877. In that year the
astronomical world was startled by the announcement
that Schiaparelli of Milan, an able and
competent observer, had discovered that those
shaded areas which all previous astronomers had
regarded as continents or vast tracts of land,
were in reality islands, that is to say, so far, that
the continents in question were cut up by innumerable
channels intersecting one another at
various angles. When this discovery was announced,
and older observations and drawings
came to be examined, it was found, or at any-rate
thought, that these so-called canals might be
traced in drawings of earlier dates by Dawes,
Secchi, and Holden. So much for 1877. In December,
1881, the planet was again in opposition,
but farther off in distance, and therefore smaller
in size than in 1877. It was, however, higher up
in the Heavens as seen at Milan and the weather
appears to have been more favourable. In these
altered circumstances Schiaparelli again saw his
canals, but this time they were in at least as many
as twenty instances seen in duplicate; that is to
say, a twin canal was seen to run parallel to the
original one at a distance of from 200 to 400
miles, as the case might be. The existence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
not only single canals but of twin canals seems
an established fact, for Schiaparelli&rsquo;s drawings
and descriptions have been confirmed by competent
testimony; but explanation is nowhere; especially
in view of Schiaparelli&rsquo;s own idea that
the duplication of his canals is perhaps not a permanent
feature but a periodical phenomenon depending
on, or connected in some way with, Mars&rsquo;s
seasons.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig13">
<img src="images/fig13.jpg" alt="Fig. 13.&mdash;Mars, August 27, 1892 (Guiot)." width="500" height="505" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 13.</span>&mdash;Mars, August 27, 1892 (Guiot).</span></p>
</div>
<p>Several points stand out clearly established
by the observations of Mars during the opposition
of 1894, especially the correctness of Schiaparelli&rsquo;s
discoveries and maps. Most of the canals originally
seen by him were again seen, and thus their
existence was confirmed, whilst new ones were
also noticed. Many of these canals were double.
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
The great extent of the S. Polar cap and its rapid
disappearance as Mars&rsquo;s summer approached was
also a special feature of the observations of 1894.
It dwindled until it became almost invisible, or at
best showed as a tiny speck. It is thought by
some observers that as the Polar cap melts, the
water collects round the Pole, and thence flows
over the planet&rsquo;s surface, giving rise to the phenomenon
of canals, and that this is the way the
planet&rsquo;s surface is irrigated. It may here be remarked
that the word &ldquo;canal,&rdquo; which has been
given to these dark streaks crossing and cutting
up the large areas of land in Mars, is an unfortunate
one, suggesting as it does artificial agency.
But these Martial canals are probably, especially
the largest, a great many miles in width and
hundreds of miles in length, though some are
smaller; and they are probably nature&rsquo;s method
of distributing over the continents and lands of
Mars the water which collects round the Pole
during the rapid melting of the Polar snows.</p>
<p>The idea of the presence of cloud or mist on
Mars also received strong confirmation in 1894.
Large portions of the planet&rsquo;s disc were found to
be hidden from view. &ldquo;Herschel I. Continent&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Maraldi Sea&rdquo; (both well-known markings
on Mars, readily visible with small telescopes)
were at times quite obscured by cloud. Indeed,
the Maraldi Sea was occasionally quite blotted
out: other well-known markings were also either
blotted out or only faintly seen. These facts
seem almost to prove conclusively the existence
of cloud and vapour in Mars, especially as some
of these markings subsequently again assumed
their ordinary form and colour. Bright projections
too were seen at times on the terminator of
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
Mars, giving rise to the belief that there are high
mountains on the planet, though some observers
regarded these projections as high clouds powerfully
reflecting the Sun&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>Mars rotates on its axis in 24h. 37m. 22s., a
period so nearly coincident with the period of the
Earth&rsquo;s rotation as greatly to facilitate the mapping
of Mars&rsquo;s features by work continued from
day to day by observers who have the necessary
instrumental means and artistic skill in handling
the pencil.</p>
<p>Mars has an atmosphere which may be said to
be no more than moderately dense; that is to say
much less dense than the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere. Of
course the existence of snow, which has been
taken for granted on a previous page, carries with
it the existence of water and aqueous vapour&mdash;a
fact capable of independent spectroscopic proof.</p>
<p>The inclination of Mars&rsquo;s axis to the ecliptic
has not been ascertained with all desirable certainty,
but if Sir W. Herschel&rsquo;s estimate that the
obliquity on Mars is 28&frac34;&deg; (the Earth&rsquo;s obliquity
being 23&frac12;&deg;) is correct, it is evident that there must
be a very close similarity between the seasons of
the Earth and the seasons of Mars, thereby furnishing
another link of proof to support the statement
made at the commencement of this chapter that,
taken all in all, Mars is the planet which bears
most resemblance to the Earth.</p>
<p>The apparent absence of satellites in the case
of Mars was long a matter of regret to astronomers;
they seemed to think that such a planet
ought to have at least one companion. At last,
in 1887, two were found by Hall at Washington,
U. S., using a very fine refractor of 26 inches
aperture. These satellites, which have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
named Phobos and Deimos, are, however, very
small, for Phobos at its best only resembles a star
of mag. 11&frac12;, whilst Deimos is no brighter than
a star of mag. 13&frac12;; from this it will be understood
that only very large telescopes will show
either of them. Phobos revolves round Mars in
7&frac12; hours at a distance of about 6000 miles, whilst
Deimos revolves in 30 hours at a distance of
about 15,000 miles. It has been thought that
neither of them can be more than about 6 or 7
miles in diameter, and therefore that they can
not afford much light to their primary.</p>
<p>Mars revolves round the Sun in 686d. 23h.
30m., at a mean distance of 141 million of miles,
which the eccentricity of its orbit may increase
to 154 millions or diminish to 128 millions. The
planet&rsquo;s apparent diameter varies between 4&Prime; in
conjunction and 30&Prime; in opposition. Owing to the
great eccentricity of the orbit the planet&rsquo;s apparent
diameter as seen from the Earth varies very
much at different oppositions. The real diameter
is rather more than 4000 miles.</p>

<br /><span class="small">THE MINOR PLANETS.</span></h2>
<p>In 1772 a German astronomer named Bode,
of Berlin, drew attention to certain curious numerical
relations subsisting between the distances
of the various planets. This &ldquo;law,&rdquo; as it has
been sometimes called, usually bears Bode&rsquo;s name,
though it was not he but J. D. Titius of Wittemberg
who really first discovered it.</p>

<p>Bode having examined these relations and
noticing the void between 16 and 52 (Ceres and
the other minor planets, and Uranus and Neptune
also, being then unknown) ventured to predict
the discovery of new planets, and this idea stimulated
him to organise a little company of astronomers
to hunt for new planets. Before, however,
this scheme was got into working order, Piazzi,
director of the Observatory at Palermo, on January
1, 1801, noted an 8th magnitude star in
Taurus, which on the next and succeeding nights
he saw again, and found had moved. He observed
the strange object for 6 weeks, when illness
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
interrupted him. However he wrote letters
announcing what he had seen, one of them to
Bode himself; but this letter, though dated Jan.
24, did not reach Bode at Berlin, till March 20&mdash;a
striking illustration of the state of the Postal
service on the Continent less than 100 years ago.
The new body, at first assumed to be a tailless
comet, was eventually recognised to be a new
planet; and the name of Ceres, the tutelary
goddess of Sicily, was at Piazzi&rsquo;s instance bestowed
upon it.</p>
<p>Looking for Ceres in March, 1802, Olbers at
Bremen, came upon another new planet, which
was afterwards named Pallas. At first he thought
he had got hold of a new variable star, but two
hours sufficed to show that the object under
notice was in motion. The two new bodies were
found to be so much alike in size and appearance,
and in their orbits, that Olbers suggested both
were but fragments of some larger body which
had been shattered by some great convulsion of
nature. The idea was a daring one, and it was
an attractive one, though now regarded as untenable.
However it served the purpose of stimulating
research, and the discovery of Pallas was
followed by that of Juno, by Harding, at Lilienthal
1804; and of Vesta, by Olbers, at Bremen in
1807.</p>
<p>The organised search for minor planets was
relinquished in 1816, presumably because no
more planets seemed to be forthcoming, and it
does not appear that any further attempts were
made by anybody till about 1830, when a Prussian
amateur, named Hencke of Driessen, profiting by
the publication of some new star maps put forth
by the Berlin Academy, commenced a methodical
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
search for small planets. These Berlin maps, one
for each hour of R. A., were only completed in
1859, and, therefore, Hencke had only a small
number of them at his command during the early
years of his labours. Still it is strange that 15
years elapsed before his zeal and perseverance
were rewarded, his first discovery, the planet
Astr&aelig;a, not taking place till December 1845.
Once however the ice was broken new planets
followed with considerable rapidity, and beginning
with 1847, no year has elapsed without several
or many having been found. During the
last decade the number detected annually has
been very great&mdash;sometimes as many as 20 in a
year, but this has been the result of photography
being brought to bear on the work. It is obvious
that if a photograph of a given field taken on
any one day is compared with a photograph
taken a few days earlier or later, and any of the
objects photographed have moved, their change
of place will soon be noticed and will be a distinct
proof of their planetary nature.</p>
<p>It seems quite certain that all the larger of
these planets have now been found, for the average
brilliancy (and this no doubt means the
average size) of those recently discovered has
been steadily diminishing year by year, and it
looks as if the limit of visibility will soon be
reached, if it has not been reached already.</p>
<p>The three largest of these bodies, in order of
size, have generally been thought to be Vesta,
Ceres, and Pallas; but Barnard, from observations
made in 1894, concluded that Ceres is 520
miles in diameter; Pallas, 304 miles; and Vesta,
241 miles. As to all the rest of the minor planets,
excepting Juno, Hornstein is of opinion that
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
those having a greater diameter than 25 geographical
miles are few in number, and that the
majority of them are no larger than from 5 to 15
miles in diameter.</p>
<p>From what has gone before the reader will
readily infer that these minor planets are of no
sort of interest to the casual amateur who dabbles
in Astronomy; and indeed that they are of very
little interest to anybody. With a few general
statistics, therefore, this chapter may be concluded.
The total number of minor planets now
known nearly reaches 500, and every year increases
the list; but not, however, at as rapid a
rate as was once the case, because the German
mathematicians, who alone latterly have been
willing to trouble themselves with the computation
of the orbits, are understood to have announced
that they are no longer able to keep
pace with the discoveries made. Those who care
to investigate in detail the circumstances of these
planets will find great extremes in the nature of
the orbits. Whilst the planet nearest to the Sun
has a period of only 3 years, the most distant occupies
nearly 9 years in performing its journey
round the Sun. So, also, there are great differences
in the eccentricities of the orbits and in
their inclinations to the ecliptic. Whilst one
planet revolves almost in the plane of the ecliptic,
another (Pallas) has an orbit which is inclined no
less than 34&deg; to the ecliptic. One word, in conclusion,
as to the names applied to these bodies.
At the outset the names given were, without exception,
chosen from the mythologies of ancient
Greece and Rome, but, latterly, the most fantastic
and ridiculous names have in many cases been
selected, names which in too many instances have
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
served no other purpose than that of displaying
the national or personal vanity of the astronomers
who applied them to the several planets. The
French are great offenders in this matter.</p>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">JUPITER.</span></h2>
<p>The planet Jupiter occupies, in one sense, the
first position in the planetary world, it being the
largest of all the planets. Moreover, with the exception
of Venus, it is the brightest of the planets.
As with Mars, and for the like reason, Jupiter,
when in the positions known as the Quadratures
(or near thereto), exhibits a slight phase, but
owing to the far greater distance from the Sun of
Jupiter, compared with Mars, the deviation of the
illuminated surface from that of a complete circle
is very small; it is, however, perceptible at or
near the time of quadrature, a slight shading off
of the limb farthest from the Sun being traceable.</p>
<p>Jupiter is noteworthy on account of two features,
both of them more or less familiar, at least
by name, to most people&mdash;its belts and its satellites,&mdash;both
of which will be described in due
course.</p>
<p>The belts are dusky streaks, which vary from
time to time both in breadth and number: most
commonly two broad belts will be seen with two
or three narrower ones on either side; but sometimes
all are rather narrow, and their narrowness
is made up for by an increase in their number.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/fig14.jpg" alt="Fig. 14.&mdash;Jupiter, November 27, 1857 (Dawes)." width="500" height="500" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 14.</span>&mdash;Jupiter, November 27, 1857 (Dawes).</span></p>
</div>
<p>Under all circumstances they lie practically parallel,
or nearly so, to the planet&rsquo;s equator. It is
generally thought that the planet, whatever may
be its actual structure or constitution, is surrounded
by a dense cloudy envelope, and that the
shaded streaks which we call belts are rifts in this
atmosphere, which expose to view the solid body
of the planet underneath. Whether, however, the
term &ldquo;solid body&rdquo; is an accurate one to be used
in this connection is thought by some to be open
to doubt. The laws which regulate the existence
of these belts are quite unknown; indeed it seems
doubtful whether any laws exist at all, for the
belts at one time appear to undergo constant
change, whilst at another time they remain almost
unchanged for several months. It has been suggested
that when the changes are rapid it must
be presumed that great atmospheric storms are
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
to be considered as in progress, and possibly this
may be the true explanation. Belts are commonly
non-existent immediately under the equator;
whilst north and south of this void space it most
usually happens that there is one broad belt and
several narrower ones in each hemisphere. At
each pole the planet&rsquo;s brightness is less than the
average brightness, but it cannot exactly be said
that this is due to the existence there of belts
properly so called.</p>
<p>It was formerly considered that no tinges of
colour could be traced on Jupiter except a silvery
gray of different degrees of intensity; but during
the last thirty years there can be no doubt that
shades of brown, red, and orange, of no great
depth, but yet quite definite have been traceable.
Many observers concur in this opinion. Whether
this detection of colour is due to an absolute development
of colour during the period in question;
or whether its detection is merely the result
of more careful scrutiny with better instruments
is a matter as to which the evidence is not clear.
Though the general position of the belts is such
that they are parallel to the planet&rsquo;s equator, yet
there are sometimes exceptions to this rule, for
in a few very rare instances a streak in the
nature of a narrow belt has been seen, inclined to
the equator at a decided angle, perhaps 20&deg; or
even more.</p>
<p>It occasionally happens that spots are seen on
Jupiter&rsquo;s belts. Sometimes these remain visible
for a considerable period. They are either dark
or luminous, and their origin is unknown. Besides
these casual spots, which are always small in size,
there was visible during many years following
1878 a very remarkable and conspicuous large
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
spot, strongly red in colour for several years,
though it afterwards became much fainter. This
spot exhibited an oval outline and was about
27,000 miles long and 8000 miles broad. For
about 4 years it maintained its intense red colour
and its shape almost unaltered; but after 1882,
the shape remaining, the colour sensibly faded.
The observations which were made on this spot
during 1886 by Professor Hough at Chicago,
U. S., with an 18-inch refractor, led him to the
opinion that the persistence of the red spot for
so many years rendered untenable the generally
accepted theory that the phenomena seen on the
surface of the planet are due to atmospheric
causes.</p>
<p>Some astronomers have thought that a relationship
subsists between the spots on the Sun
and the spots on Jupiter. There certainly seems
an apparent identity in point of time between the
two classes of spots, and on the assumption that
the spots on Jupiter are indicative of disturbances
on the planet, Ranyard broached the idea
that both classes of phenomena are dependent on
some extraneous cosmical change; and are not
related as cause and effect. Browning suggested
many years ago that the red colour of the belts
is a periodical phenomenon coinciding with the
epoch of the greatest display of sunspots, but this
thought does not appear to have been followed up
by any one. Spots on Jupiter seem to have been
first recorded by Robert Hooke in 1664. In the
following year Cassini saw a spot which he found
to be in motion, and by following it attentively
he inferred that the planet rotated on its axis in
9h. 56m. It is a remarkable illustration of the
great care bestowed by Cassini on his astronomical
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
work that the best modern determinations of
Jupiter&rsquo;s rotation-period differ from Cassini&rsquo;s estimate
by only half a minute.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the enormous size of Jupiter
compared with the Earth, whilst its period of rotation
is considerably less than half the Earth&rsquo;s,
it will be at once seen that the velocity of matter
at the planet&rsquo;s equator is immensely great&mdash;466
miles per minute against the Earth&rsquo;s 17 miles per
minute. One result of this is the great intensity
of the centrifugal force at the equator, and likewise
the greatness of the compression of the
planet&rsquo;s body at the poles. Hind has suggested
that the great velocity which thus evidently exists
may have the effect, by reason of the development
of the heat which it gives rise to, of compensating
the planet for the small amount of
heat which owing to its distance it receives from
the Sun.</p>
<p>On favourable occasions the brilliancy of Jupiter
is very considerable; so much so that it
rivals Venus and Mars. And besides this, there
appears to be something special in the nature of
Jupiter&rsquo;s surface, for not only does it seem to
radiate a much larger proportion of the solar
light which falls on it than do the planets generally,
but some observers have expressed the opinion
that it possesses inherent light of its own.
Speculations, however, such as this must always
be received with reserve, because of the evident
difficulty of making sure of the facts on which
they must be based. One thing, however, seems
less open to doubt. Bearing in mind the small
amount of heat which reaches Jupiter from the
Sun, there is reason to infer that the clouds which
certainly exist on Jupiter must owe their origin to
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
the influence of some other heat than solar heat;
in other words that Jupiter possesses sources of
heat within itself.</p>
<p>Jupiter has satellites, 5 in number. The discovery
of four of these, was one of the first fruits
of the invention of the telescope, for they were
found by Galileo in January, 1610. The 5th satellite
is so small that it escaped notice until as
recently as 1892, having been discovered on September
9 of that year by Professor Barnard, with
the great Lick telescope in California. It is, however,
so minute that one can count on one&rsquo;s fingers
the telescopes capable of showing it.</p>
<p>The four old satellites of Jupiter shine as
stars of about the 7th magnitude; in other words,
they are sufficiently bright to be visible with telescopes
however small: indeed several instances
are on record of persons gifted with very good
sight, having been able to see them with the naked
eye. For the study of their physical appearance
very powerful optical assistance is necessary, but
their movements are so rapid, and the phenomena
which result from those movements are so interesting,
that these bodies may be considered to
occupy the first place in the stock-in-trade of
every amateur astronomer, who lays himself out
for planet-gazing, with the object of profiting
himself or his friends. The phenomena here
alluded to are known as eclipses, transits, and
occultations.</p>
<p>The four old satellites do not bear any names,
but are numbered from the innermost outwards,
and are always alluded to by their numbers as I,
II, III and IV.</p>
<p>An eclipse of a Jovian satellite is identical in
principle with an eclipse of the Moon; that is to
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
say, just as an eclipse of the Moon happens when
the Moon passes into and is lost in the Earth&rsquo;s
shadow, so an eclipse of a Jovian satellite happens
when such satellite becomes lost in the
shadow cast by the planet into space. The Ist
IInd and IIIrd satellites in consequence of the
smallness of the inclination of their orbits, undergo
eclipse once in every revolution round their
primary, but the IVth is less often eclipsed, owing
to the joint effect of its considerable orbital inclination,
and of the distance to which it recedes from
its primary.</p>
<p>An occultation of a Jovian satellite is akin in
principle to an occultation of a star by the Moon.
As the Moon moving forwards suddenly covers a
star, so the planet, on occasions, suddenly covers
one of its satellites. If the satellite in question
is the IVth, its disappearance behind the planet
and its reappearance from behind the planet will
both be visible in due succession. This is often
true also of the IIIrd satellite, but for reasons
connected with the proximity to their primary of
the Ist and IInd satellites, only their disappearance
<i>or</i> reappearance (not both) can, as a rule, be
observed on the same occasion. The most interesting,
by far, however, of the phenomena connected
with Jupiter&rsquo;s satellites are their transits
in front of, that is across, the visible disc of the
planet. Though these transits are of frequent
occurrence, yet they are always interesting because
of the diverse appearances which the satellites
exhibit at different times, and which cannot
be said to be in accordance with any recognised
laws. Moreover, in observing the transit of a
satellite, we may often see the black shadow cast
by the satellite on the planet&rsquo;s disc; and this
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
shadow will sometimes precede and sometimes
follow the satellite itself. From the fact that the
satellite generally appears as a bright spot on a
bright background whilst the shadow is black, or
blackish, an inexperienced observer is apt to
look at the shadow and think he is seeing the
satellite.</p>
<p>Jupiter revolves round the Sun in not quite 12
years at a mean distance of 483 millions of miles.
Its apparent diameter varies between 50&Prime; and 30&Prime;
according to its position with respect to the Earth.
Its true diameter is about 88,000 miles. Owing
to its large size and rapid rotation, as has already
been mentioned, Jupiter is very much flattened at
the poles. The amount of this (the polar &ldquo;compression&rdquo;
as it is called) is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>.</p>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">SATURN.</span></h2>
<p>Next beyond Jupiter, proceeding outwards
from the Sun, we reach the planet Saturn, which
beyond any doubt is the most beautiful and most
interesting of all the planets. Nobody who has
ever had a fairly good chance of seeing it can
have the least doubt that this is the case. Briefly
stated the three main features which constitute its
claims are:&mdash;(1) Its belts, (2) its rings, (3) its satellites.</p>
<p>The belts of Saturn resemble generally those
of Jupiter, but they are more faint and less
changeable. Their physical cause, however, may
be assumed to be the same. Taking the planet
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
as a whole, it may be said that its ordinary colour
is yellowish white, the belts inclining to grayish
white; though the dark belts have often been
thought to exhibit a greenish hue. Lassell considered
that the south pole is generally darker
than the north pole and more blue in tinge.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/fig15.jpg" alt="Fig. 15.&mdash;Saturn, Jan. 26, 1889 (Antoniadi)." width="500" height="271" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 15.</span>&mdash;Saturn, Jan. 26, 1889 (Antoniadi).</span></p>
</div>
<p>There is one important particular in which
the belts of Saturn differ from those of Jupiter.
Jupiter&rsquo;s belts are straight, whereas Saturn&rsquo;s are
sensibly curved. Supposing, as is probable, that
Saturn&rsquo;s belts are parallel to the planet&rsquo;s equator,
then we must assume that the plane of this equator
makes a rather considerable angle with the
ecliptic. Spots on Saturn are very rare. Whether
Saturn has an atmosphere seems uncertain, or
perhaps it may be said that one has not been
proved to exist but may exist. The question of
polar snow is also uncertain, but Sir W. Herschel
thought he could trace changes of hue at the poles
which might be due to the melting of snow.</p>
<p>It is usual to speak of the planet itself under
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
the name of the &ldquo;Ball&rdquo; when it is not a question
of referring to the whole Saturnian system collectively.
In consequence of its distance from the
Sun, Saturn undergoes no equivalent to a phase;
or to be more exact, no phase can be detected,
though theoretically when the planet is in quadrature
the disc must undergo an infinitesimally
small loss of light.</p>
<p>Though the point has now-a-days no scientific
importance, it may perhaps be desirable just to
make a brief allusion to Sir W. Herschel&rsquo;s curious
theory that Saturn was seen by him to be compressed
not only at the poles but at the equator,
so that it resembled a parallelogram with the corners
rounded off. It is difficult to imagine what
could have given rise to this strange idea, though,
of course, Herschel&rsquo;s good faith in advancing it
cannot be called in question. I refer to it because
it will be found mentioned in so many books on
astronomy, often under the name of the &ldquo;square-shouldered&rdquo;
figure of Saturn. As a theory it may
be regarded as quite exploded in consequence of
accurate measures by Bessel, Main and others having
conclusively shown that the form of the ball
does not depart from that of a regular spheroid.</p>
<p>In referring to Saturn generally, we speak of
its ring in the singular number, but, in point of
fact, there are several rings&mdash;three in particular.
The principal bright ring is really double, and
within the innermost bright ring there is a dusky
one, perfect as a ring, but not luminous as the
outer rings are. By way of distinguishing one
ring from another, it is usual to adopt Struve&rsquo;s
nomenclature, whereby the outermost bright ring
is called A, the inner bright ring B, and the dusky
ring C.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>A good engraving will convey more fully and
more clearly an idea of what the Saturnian system
consists of than the fullest verbal description
will do. (See <i>Frontispiece</i>.)</p>
<p>To the earliest astronomers who possessed telescopes,
Saturn proved a great puzzle, because it
seemed to undergo changes of shape which were
quite inexplicable on any principles then known.
Galileo, when first he saw it, thought it presented
an oval outline which might be due to a central
planet having a smaller planet on each side of it,
and accordingly he announced to his friend, Kepler,
that the most distant planet was <i>tergeminum</i> or
tri-form. But greater magnifying power led him
to arrive at the conclusion that the planet was not
a triple combination of spheres, but one body,
either oblong or oval in outline. This conclusion,
however, was soon found to be untenable, because
the two (supposed) tributary bodies gradually decreased
in size until they entirely disappeared.
Galileo writing to his friend, Welser, in December
1612, thus expressed himself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is to be said concerning so strange a
metamorphosis? Are the two lesser stars consumed
after the manner of the solar spots?
Have they vanished or suddenly fled? Has Saturn,
perhaps, devoured his own children? Or
were the appearances indeed illusion or fraud,
with which the glasses have so long deceived me,
as well as many others to whom I have shewn
them? Now, perhaps, is the time come to revive
the well-nigh withered hopes of those who, guided
by more profound contemplations, have discovered
the fallacy of the new observations, and demonstrated
the utter impossibility of their existence.
I do not know what to say in a case so surprising,
so unlooked for, and so novel. The shortness of
the time, the unexpected nature of the event, the
weakness of my understanding, and the fear of
being mistaken have greatly confounded me.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Galileo seems to have become so out of heart
in consequence of the difficulty of determining
what these changes really meant, that he gave up
altogether observing Saturn. In the course of
time, but by very gradual steps, astronomers
came to realise what the facts were. The next
idea that was broached, was that the planet consisted
of simply one central ball, and that the
excrescences which Galileo had been puzzled by
were merely handles as they were called, (<i>ans&aelig;</i>)
projecting like the handles, say of a soup tureen,
though why they should vary in size at stated
intervals remained as great a mystery as ever.
It was not until about 1656 that the true explanation
was arrived at by a Dutchman, named
Christopher Huygens. It was the fashion in
those days for scientific men to intimate to the
world discoveries which they had made by resort
to mysterious anagrams, which served in some
degree the purpose which in the present day is
served by the law regulating copyright or patent
rights. Accordingly Huygens published the following
singular memorandum:&mdash;</p>
<p>aaaaaaa cccc d eeeee g h i iiiiii llll mm nnnnnnnnn oo oo pp q rr s ttttt uuuuu.</p>
<p>These letters arranged in their proper order
furnish the following Latin sentence:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Annulo cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam cohaerente,
ad eclipticam inclinato</i>; which Latin sentence becomes
in the English tongue:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;[The planet] is surrounded by a slender flat
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
ring inclined to the ecliptic, but which nowhere
touches [the body of the planet.]&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huygen&rsquo;s discovery was not a mere piece of
guesswork, for he spent several years carefully
observing the alterations of form which Saturn
underwent, before he came to the conclusion that
it was only the existence of a ring surrounding
the planet which would explain the various observed
changes.</p>
<p>It was by way of guarding himself from being
robbed of the fruits of his discovery whilst he
was accumulating the necessary proof of its truth,
that he buried his thoughts in the logogriph or
anagram just quoted. Having arrived at the
conclusion which he did, he thought himself sufficiently
sure of his facts to predict that in July
or August 1671, the planet would again appear
round, the ring becoming invisible. This surmise
proved practically correct, in so far, that in May
1671, or within 2 months of the time predicted
by Huygens, Cassini saw the planet as a simple
ball unaccompanied by any ring.</p>
<p>This is a convenient place at which to offer a
brief explanation of the changes of appearance as
regards the ball and rings which Saturn undergoes.
These changes depend jointly on Saturn&rsquo;s
motion in its orbit round the Sun, and on the
corresponding motion of the Earth in its orbit.
Neither Saturn nor the Earth revolve round the
Sun exactly in the ecliptic, and this want of coincidence
results in the fact, that twice in the 29&frac12;
years occupied by Saturn in journeying round the
Sun, the plane of its ring is seen edgeways by us
on the Earth; whilst at two other periods intermediate
but equi-distant the ring is seen opened
out to the widest possible extent; that is, so far
as we on the Earth can by any possibility have a
chance of seeing it.</p>

<p>The appearances presented by the rings when
undergoing the transformations to which they
are subject, will be readily understood by an inspection
of the annexed engravings. Fig. 17,
indicates the actual appearances in the years
specified, and these years may be considered as
carried forward and brought up to date by substituting
1877 for 1848, 1885 for 1855, 1891 for
1862, and 1898 for 1869.</p>
<p>Adverting to fig. 16, it will suffice to remark
that the two central phases of the rings, opened
wide, are to be deemed co-related, or indeed
identical in a geometrical sense (so to speak)
the difference being that one of them is to be
deemed to show the northern side of the ring
(which is now in view and will continue in view
till 1907) whilst the other represents the southern
side, which was in view from 1877 till 1891. The
foregoing is a brief statement of the general principle
involved in the changes which take place,
but the motions of the two planets introduce certain
technical complications into the details which
would be seen by an observer using a large telescope;
with these, however, the ordinary reader
will not care to concern himself, and need not
do so.</p>
<p>A great deal might be said with respect to the
rings treated descriptively. I will now mention
a few matters of general interest. Huygens regarded
the appendage to Saturn, whose existence
he established, to be a single ring, but as far back
as 1675, Cassini determined that Huygen&rsquo;s single
ring was really made up of two, one lying inside
the other. Cassini in this conclusion outstepped
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
not only all the observers of his own century, but
those of the succeeding century, for Sir W. Herschel
even 100 years after Cassini, was for a long
time unable to satisfy himself, even with his
superior telescopes, that the black streaks seen
in the ring by Cassini, and regarded by him as
indicative of a severance of the ring into two
parts, really implied a severance. It is now, however,
accepted as a fact that not only are the
rings which are known as A and B absolutely
distinct, but that A also is itself certainly duplex,
that is, that it certainly consists of two independent
rings. In addition to this many competent
observers armed with powerful telescopes have
obtained traces of other sub-divisions, both in A
and B; and though there is some want of harmony
in the details, as stated by the different
observers, yet undoubtedly we must speak of
Saturn&rsquo;s rings collectively as forming a <i>multiple</i>
system.</p>
<p>What the rings are is a highly debatable
point, but the preponderating idea is that they
are not what they appear to be, namely solid
masses of matter, but are swarms of independent
fragments of matter. Yet &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; is not the
best word to use, because it implies that something
has been broken up to make the fragments.
Rather, perhaps, we should say with Professor
Young, that the rings are &ldquo;composed of a swarm
of separate particles, each a little independent
moon pursuing its own path around the planet.
The idea was suggested long ago, by J. Cassini in
1715, and by Wright in 1750, but was lost sight of
until Bond revived it in connection with his discovery
of the dusky ring. Professor Benjamin
Pierce soon afterwards demonstrated that the
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
rings could not be continuous solids; and Clerk
Maxwell finally showed that they can be neither
solid nor liquid sheets, but that all the known
conditions would be answered by supposing them
to consist of a flock of separate and independent
bodies, moving in orbits nearly circular, and in
one plane&mdash;in fact, a swarm of meteors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thickness of the rings seen edgeways has
been variously estimated. Sir J. Herschel suggested
250 miles as an outside limit, which G. P.
Bond reduced to 40 miles. It is generally considered,
however, that 100 miles is probably not
far from the truth. Young has pointed out that
if a model of them were constructed on the scale
of 1 inch to represent 10,000 miles, so that the
outer ring of such a model would be nearly 17
inches in diameter, then the thickness of the ring
would be represented by that of an ordinary sheet
of writing paper.</p>
<p>Considered as a system, the rings are distinctly
more luminous than the planet, and of the two
bright rings, the inner one is brighter than the
outer one; and the inner one is less bright at its
inner edge than elsewhere. It is also to be
noticed that when seen edgeways just about the
time of the Saturnian equinoxes, when the Sun is
shifting over from one side of the ring to the
other, and the ring is dwindling down to a narrow
streak, its edges (forming the <i>ans&aelig;</i> as they are
termed) do not disappear and reappear at the
same time, and are not always of the same apparent
extent. One ansa, indeed, is sometimes
visible without the other, and most commonly it
is the Eastern one that is missing. To what
causes these various peculiarities are due is unknown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Many physical peculiarities have been either
noticed or suspected with reference to the bright
rings. For instance, on comparing one with
another, some persons have thought that their
surfaces are convex, and that they do not lie in
the same plane. The existence of mountains on
their surface has more than once been suspected.
Again, it has been fancied that they are surrounded
by an extensive atmosphere. It seems
hardly likely that the rings would have an atmosphere
and not the ball (or <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>), and, therefore,
no wonder that we have no observations
which countenance the idea that the ball does
really possess an atmosphere. This, indeed,
seems to flow from Trouvelot&rsquo;s observation, that
the ball is less luminous at its circumference than
at its centre.</p>
<p>The circumstances of ring C, otherwise called
the &ldquo;Dusky&rdquo; or &ldquo;Crape&rdquo; ring are as curious
historically, as they are mysterious physically.
In 1838, Galle of Breslau, noticed what he
thought to be a gradual shading off of the interior
bright ring towards the ball. Though he
published a statement of what he saw, the matter
seems to have attracted little or no notice. In
1850, G. P. Bond in America perceived something
luminous between the ring and the ball, and after
repeated observations in concert with his father,
came to the conclusion that the luminous appearance
which he saw, was neither less nor more
than an independent and imperfectly illuminated
ring lying within the old rings and concentric
with them. Before, however, tidings of Bond&rsquo;s
discovery reached England, but a few days after
the discovery in point of actual date, Dawes suddenly
noticed one evening as Bond had done, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
luminous shading within the bright rings, which
he was not long in finding out to be in reality a
complete ring, except so far that a portion of it
was of course hidden from view behind the ball.
He, and O. Struve likewise, noticed that this new
Dusky Ring was occasionally to be seen divided
into two or more rings. The Dusky Ring is
transparent, though this fact was not ascertained
until 1852, or two years after Bond&rsquo;s discovery of
the ring.</p>
<p>The Dusky Ring is now recognised as a permanent
feature of Saturn, but how far it used to
be permanent, or how long it has been so, is a
matter wrapped in doubt. Recorded observations
by Picard in 1673, and by Hadley in 1723, made
of course with telescopes infinitely less powerful
than those of the present day, seem to suggest
that both the observers named saw the Dusky
Ring, without, however, being able to form a
clear conception that it was a ring. It is strange
that during the long period from 1723 to 1838,
no one&mdash;not even Sir W. Herschel, with his various
telescopes&mdash;should have obtained or at least
have recorded any suspicion of its existence.
There is, however, direct evidence that the Dusky
Ring is wider and less faint than formerly. This
was directly confirmed by Carpenter in 1863, who
says he saw it &ldquo;nearly as bright as the illuminated
ring, so much so, that it might easily have
been mistaken for a part of it.&rdquo; In 1883, Davidson
found a marked difference in the brilliancy of
the two ends (<i>ans&aelig;</i>) of the ring.</p>
<p>In 1889 Barnard was fortunate enough to observe
an eclipse of one of Saturn&rsquo;s satellites by
the ring, but the eclipse, that is the concealment
of the satellite, was only effected when it passed
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
behind the bright rings; the dusky ring did not
obliterate it, and hence there was obtained a conclusive
proof of the transparency of the dusky
ring. Barnard further concluded from his observations
that there was no separating space or
division between the inner bright ring and the
dusky ring, as has frequently been represented in
drawings. This transparency of the Dusky Ring,
as a matter of fact, is therefore undoubted; yet
what are we to consider to be the meaning of an
observation by Wray in 1861, that whilst looking
at the dusky ring edgeways the impression was
conveyed to his eye that that ring was very much
thicker than the bright rings?</p>
<p>A very interesting question which has been
much discussed has reference to the stability of
the rings. It is generally agreed that the constituent
particles of the rings must be in motion
round the primary or their equilibrium could not
be maintained: almost equally certain is it, and
for the like reason, that the rings cannot be solid.
Of actual change in the rings as regards their
dimensions, we have no satisfactory proof, though
authorities differ on the point, some thinking that
the rings are expanding inwards, so that ultimately
they will come into contact with the ball,
whilst others consider no proof whatever of such
change can be obtained from any of the observations
yet made in the way of measurements.</p>
<p>We must now proceed to consider the satellites
of Saturn. These are 8 in number, 7 of
which move in orbits whose planes coincide
nearly with the planet&rsquo;s equator, whilst the remaining
one is inclined about 12&deg; thereto. One
consequence of this coincidence in the planes of
these satellites, which, it should be stated, are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
7 innermost, is that they are always visible to the
inhabitants of both hemispheres when they are
not actually undergoing eclipse in the shadow of
Saturn. The satellites are of various sizes, and
succeed one another in the following order, reckoning
from the nearest, outwards:&mdash;Mimas, Enceladus,
Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion
and Iapetus. Any good 2-inch telescope will
show Titan; a 3-inch will sometimes show Iapetus;
a 4-inch will show Iapetus well, together
with Rhea and Dione, but hardly Tethys; all the
others require large telescopes. If Saturn has
any inhabitants at all constituted like ourselves,
which is highly improbable, they will have a
chance of seeing celestial phenomena of the
greatest interest. What with the rings surrounding
the planet and 8 moons in constant motion,
there will be an endless succession of astronomical
sights for them to study. The amount of
light received from the Sun cannot be much&mdash;barely
1/100th what the earth receives. The
ring and satellites will therefore be useful as supplementary
sources of light; yet the satellites
will not furnish much, for it has been calculated
that the surface of the sky occupied by all the
satellites put together would to a dweller on
Saturn only amount to 6 times the area of the
sky covered by our Moon; whilst the intrinsic
brightness of all put together would be no more
than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>th part of the light which we receive from
our Moon.</p>
<p>The only physical fact worth noting here in
connection with the satellites concerns Iapetus.
Cassini two centuries ago with his indifferent telescopes
thought he had ascertained that this satellite
was subject to considerable variations of brilliancy.
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
Sir W. Herschel confirmed Cassini as to
this. He found that it was much less brilliant
when traversing the eastern half of its orbit than
at other times. Two conclusions have been drawn
from this fact. One is that the satellite rotates
once on its axis in the same time that it performs
one revolution round its primary; and that there
are portions of its surface which are almost entirely
incapable of reflecting the rays of the Sun.
This last named supposition may perhaps be well
founded, but the former needs more proof than is
as yet forthcoming. Iapetus on the whole may
be said to shine as a star of the 9th magnitude.
To this it may be added that Titan is of the 8th
magnitude, but all the others much smaller.</p>

</div>
<p>Saturn revolves round the Sun in a little under
29&frac12; years at a mean distance of 886 millions of
miles. Its apparent diameter varies between 15&Prime;
and 20&Prime;; its true diameter may be put at 75,000
miles. The flattening of the poles, or &ldquo;polar
compression&rdquo; as it is called, is greater than that
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
of any other planet, but is usually less noticeable
than in the case of Jupiter, because the ring is
apt to distract the eye, except when near the edgeways
phase. The compression may be taken at <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.</p>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="small">URANUS.</span></h2>
<p>To the Ancients Saturn was the outermost
planet of the System, nothing beyond it being
known. Nor indeed was it to be assumed that
any more could possibly exist, because Mercury,
Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, with
the Sun, made 7 celestial bodies of prime importance;
and 7 was the number of perfection; and
there was thus provided one celestial body to give
a name to each of the days of the week.</p>
<p>But Science is not sentimental; and when men
of Science come upon what looks like a discovery
they do their best to bring their discovery to a
successful issue, however much people&rsquo;s prejudices
may seem to stand in the way at the moment.</p>
<p>On a certain evening in March, 1781, Sir William
Herschel, then gradually coming into notice
as a practical astronomer, was engaged in looking
at different fields of stars in the constellation
Gemini when he lighted on one which at once attracted
his special attention. Altering his eyepiece,
and substituting a higher magnifying power
he found the apparent size of the mysterious object
enlarged, which conclusively proved that it
was not a star; for it is a well-known optical
property of all stars that whatever be the size of
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
telescope employed on them, and however high
the magnifying power no definite disc of light can
be obtained when in focus. Herschel&rsquo;s new find,
therefore, was plainly not a star, and no idea having
in those days come into men&rsquo;s minds of there
being any new planets awaiting discovery, he announced
as a matter of course that he had found
a new comet, so soon as he ascertained that the
new body was in motion. The announcement
was not made to the Royal Society till April 26,
more than six weeks after the date of the actual
discovery, an indication, by the way, of the dilatory
circulation of news a hundred years ago.
The supposed comet was observed by Maskelyne,
the Astronomer Royal, four days after Herschel had
first seen it, and Maskelyne seems to have at once
got the idea into his head that he was looking at
a planet and not at a comet. As soon as possible
after the discovery of a new comet the practice
of astronomers is to endeavour to determine what
is the shape of the orbit which it is pursuing. All
attempts to carry out this in the case of Herschel&rsquo;s
supposed new comet proved abortive, because it
was found impossible to harmonise, except for a
short period of time, the movements of the new
body with the form of curve usually affected by
most comets, namely, the parabola. It is true, as
we shall see later on in speaking of comets, that
a certain number of those bodies do revolve in
the closed curve known as the ellipse, but it is
usual to calculate the parabolic form first of all,
because it is the easier to calculate; and to persevere
with it until it plainly appears that the parabola
will not fit in with the observed movements
of the new object. This practice was carried out
in the case of Herschel&rsquo;s new body, and it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
eventually found that not only was its orbit not
parabolic; that not only was its orbit not an elongated
ellipse of the kind affected by comets; but
that it was nearly a circle, and as the body itself
showed a defined disc the conclusion was inevitable:
it was in real truth a new planet. It has not
taken long to write this statement, and it will
take still less time for the reader to read what
has been written, but the result just mentioned
occupied the attention of astronomers many
months in working out, step by step, in such a
way as to make sure that no mistake had been
made.</p>
<p>When it was once clearly determined that
Herschel had added a new planet to the list of
known planets it became an interesting matter
of inquiry to find out whether it had ever been
seen before; and to settle the name it should bear.
A little research soon showed that the new planet
had been seen and recorded as a fixed star by
various observers on 20 previous occasions, beginning
as far back as Dec. 13, 1690, when Flamstead
registered at Greenwich as a star. These
various observations, spread over a period of 91
years, and all recorded by observers of skill and
eminence materially helped astronomers in their
efforts to calculate accurately the shape and nature
of the new planet&rsquo;s orbit. One observer, a
Frenchman named Le Monnier, saw the planet no
less than 12 times between 1750 and 1771, and if
he had had (which it is known he had not) an orderly
and methodical mind, the glory of this discovery
would have been lost to England and
obtained by France. Arago has left it on record
that he was once shown one of these chance observations
of Uranus, which had been recorded
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
by Le Monnier on an old paper bag in which hair
powder had been sold by a perfumer.</p>
<p>A long discussion took place on the question
of a name for the new planet. Bode&rsquo;s suggestion
of &ldquo;Uranus&rdquo; is now in universal use, but it is
within the recollection of many persons living
that this planet bore sometimes the name of the
&ldquo;Georgium Sidus&rdquo; and sometimes the name of
&ldquo;Herschel.&rdquo; The former designation was proposed
by Herschel himself in compliment to his
sovereign and patron George III. of England;
whilst a French astronomer suggested the latter
name. However, neither of these appellations
was acceptable to the astronomers of the Continent,
who declared in favour of a mythological
name, though it was a long time before they
agreed to accept Bode&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uranus.&rdquo; The symbol
commonly used to represent the planet is formed
of Herschel&rsquo;s initial with a little circle added
below, though the Germans employ something
else, &ldquo;made in Germany,&rdquo; to quote a too familiar
phrase.</p>
<p>The visible disc of Uranus is so small that
none but telescopes of the very largest size can
make anything of it. A few sentences therefore
will dispose of this part of the subject. The disc
is usually bluish in tinge, and most observers who
look at it consider it uniformly bright, but there
is satisfactory testimony to the effect that under
the most favourable circumstances of instrument
and atmosphere two or more belts, not unlike the
belts of Jupiter, may be traced. From the position
in which these belts have been seen it is inferred
that the satellites of Uranus (presently to
be mentioned) are unusually much inclined to the
planet&rsquo;s equator, and revolve in a retrograde direction,
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
contrary to what is the ordinary rule of the
planets and satellites. It is assumed as the basis
of these ideas, (and by analogy it is reasonable
to do this) that the belts are practically parallel
to the planet&rsquo;s equator, and at right angles to the
planet&rsquo;s axis of rotation. To speak of the planet&rsquo;s
axis of rotation is, in one sense, another assumption,
because available observations can scarcely
be said to enable us to demonstrate that the planet
does rotate on its axis, yet we can have no moral
doubt about it. Taylor has suggested grounds
for the opinion that &ldquo;there can be very little
doubt that Uranus is to a very large extent self-luminous,
and that we do not see it wholly by reflected
light.&rdquo; To this Gore adds the idea that
there is &ldquo;strong evidence in favour of the existence
of intrinsic heat in the planet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uranus is attended by several satellites. It
was once thought that there were eight, of which
six were due to Sir W. Herschel, the other two
being of modern discovery. Astronomers are,
however, now agreed that no more than four
satellites can justly be recognised as known to
exist, and they are so minute in size that only the
very largest telescopes will show them; and therefore
our knowledge of them is extremely limited.
Sir W. Herschel&rsquo;s idea that he had seen six satellites
appears to have resulted from his having on
some occasions mistaken some very small stars
for satellites. Two only of his six are thought
to have been real satellites. The other two recognised
satellites were found both in 1847, one by
Lassell, and the other by O. Struve.</p>
<p>Uranus revolves round the Sun in rather more
than 84 years, at a mean distance of 1781 millions
of miles. Its apparent diameter, seen from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
Earth, does not vary much from 3&frac12;&Prime; which corresponds
to about 31,000 miles. It has been calculated
that the light received from the Sun by
Uranus would be about the amount furnished by
300 full Moons seen by us on the Earth, though
another authority increases this to 1670 full
Moons. From Uranus Saturn can be seen, and
perhaps Jupiter, both as inferior planets, just as
we see Venus and Mercury; but all the other
inner planets, including Mars and the Earth,
would be hopelessly lost to view, because perpetually
too close to the Sun. Possibly, however,
they might, on rare occasions, be seen in
transit across the Sun&rsquo;s disc. Neptune, of course,
would be visible and be the only superior planet.
The Sun itself would appear to an observer on
Uranus as a very bright star, with a disc of 1&frac34;&prime; of
arc in diameter.</p>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">NEPTUNE.</span></h2>
<p>We now come to the best known planet of
the solar system, reckoning outwards from the
Sun, and though this planet itself, as an object to
look at, has no particular interest for the general
public, yet the history of its discovery is a matter
of extreme interest. Moreover, it is very closely
mixed up with the history of the planet Uranus,
which has just been described. After Uranus
had become fully recognised as a regular member
of the solar system, a French astronomer named
Alexis Bouvard set himself the task of exhaustively
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
considering the movements of Uranus with
a view of determining its orbit with the utmost
possible exactness. His available materials
ranged themselves in two groups:&mdash;the modern
observations between 1781 and 1820, and the
early observations of Flamsteed, Bradley, Mayer,
and Le Monnier, extending from 1690 to 1771.
Bouvard found in substance that he could frame
an orbit which would fit in with each group of
observations, but that he could not obtain an
orbit which would reconcile both sets of observations
during the 130 years over which they jointly
extended. He therefore rashly came to the conclusion
that the earlier observations, having been
made when methods and instruments were alike
relatively imperfect, were probably inaccurate or
otherwise untrustworthy, and had better be rejected.
This seemed for awhile to solve the difficulty,
and results which he published in 1821 represented
with all reasonable accuracy the then
movements of the planet. A very few years, however,
sufficed to reveal discordances between observation
and theory, so marked and regular as
to make it perfectly clear that it was not Bouvard&rsquo;s
work which was faulty but that Uranus
itself had gone astray through the operation of
definite but as yet unknown causes. What these
causes were could only be a matter of surmise
based upon the evident fact that there was some
source of disturbance which was evidently throwing
Uranus out of its proper place and regular
course. First one and then another astronomer
gave attention and thought to the matter, and
eventually the conclusion was arrived at that
there existed, more remote from the Sun than
Uranus, an undiscovered planet which was able
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
to make its influence felt by deranging the movements
of Uranus in its ordinary journey round
the Sun every 84 years. This conclusion on the
part of astronomers becoming known, a young
Cambridge student, then at St. John&rsquo;s College,
John Couch Adams by name, resolved, in July
1841, to take up the subject, though it was not
until 1843 that he actually did so. The problem
to be solved was to suggest the precise place in
the sky at a given time of an imaginary planet
massive enough to push, or pull, out of its normal
place the planet Uranus, which was evidently
being pushed at one time and pulled at another.
It would also be part of the problem to predict
the distance from the Sun of the planet thus imagined
to exist. Adams worked patiently and
silently at this very profound and difficult problem
for 1&frac34; years when he found himself able to
forward to Airy, who had become Astronomer
Royal after being a Cambridge Professor, some
provisional elements of an imaginary planet of a
size, at a distance, and in a position to meet the
circumstances. It is greatly to be regretted, on
more grounds than one, that Airy did nothing but
pigeon-hole Adams&rsquo;s papers. Had he done what
might have been, and probably was, expected,
that is, had he made them public, or better still
had he made telescopic use of them, a long and
unpleasant international controversy would have
been avoided, and Adams would not have been
robbed in part of the well-deserved fruits of his
protracted labours.</p>
<p>We must now turn to consider something that
was happening in France. In the summer of
1845, just before Adams had finished his work,
and one and a half years after he commenced it
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
a young Frenchman, who afterwards rose to
great eminence, U. J. J. Le Verrier, turned his
attention to the movements of Uranus with a
view of ascertaining the cause of their recognised
irregularity. In November 1845 he made public
the conclusion that those irregularities did not
exclusively depend upon Jupiter or Saturn. He
followed this up in June 1846 by a second memoir
to prove that an unknown exterior planet was the
cause of all the trouble, and he assigned evidence
as to its position very much as Adams had done
8 months previously. Airy on receiving a copy
of Le Verrier&rsquo;s memoir seems so far, at last, to
have been roused that he took the trouble to
compare Le Verrier&rsquo;s conclusions with those of
Adams so long in his possession neglected. Finding
that a remarkably close accord existed between
the conclusions of the two men, he came to
realise that both must be of value, and he wrote
a fortnight later to suggest to Professor Challis
the desirability of his instituting a search for the
suspected planet. Challis began within two days,
but was handicapped by not having in his possession
any map of the stars in the neighbourhood
suggested as the <i>locale</i> of the planet. He lost no
time however in making such a map, but, of
course, the doing so caused an appreciable delay,
and it was not until September 29, 1846, that he
found an object which excited his suspicions and
eventually proved to be the planet sought for. It
was subsequently ascertained that the planet had
been recorded as a star on August 4 and 12, and
that the star of August 12 was missing from the
zone observed on July 30. The discovery of the
planet was therefore just missed on August 12
because the results of each evening&rsquo;s work were
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
not adequately compared with what had gone
before.</p>
<p>Meanwhile things had not been standing still
in France. In August 1846, Le Verrier published
a third memoir intended to develope information
respecting the probable position of the planet in
the heavens. In September 23 a summary of this
third memoir was received by Encke at Berlin,
accompanied by the request that he would cooperate
instrumentally in the search for it. Encke
at once directed two of his assistants named
D&rsquo;Arrest and Galle to do this, and they were fortunately
well circumstanced for the task. Unlike
Challis, who, as we have seen, could do nothing
until he had made a map for himself, the Berlin
observers had one ready to hand, which by good
chance had just been published by the Berlin
Academy for the part of the heavens which both
Adams and Le Verrier assigned as the probable
locality in which the anxiously desired planet
would be found. Galle called out the visible
stars one by one whilst D&rsquo;Arrest checked them
by the map, and suddenly he came upon an unmarked
object which at the moment looked like
an 8th magnitude star. The following night
showed that the suspicious object was in motion,
and it was soon ascertained to be the trans-Uranian
planet which was being searched for. The
discovery when announced excited the liveliest
interest all over the world. It did more; it created
a bitter feeling of resentment on the part of
French astronomers that the laurels claimed by
them should have been also claimed in an equal
share by a young and unknown Englishman, and
accordingly the old cry of &ldquo;<i>perfide Albion</i>&rdquo; arose
on all sides. I have been particular in stating
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
the various dates which belong to this narrative,
in order to make as clear as possible the facts of
the case. This is even now necessary, because
though the astronomers of England and Germany
are willing to give Adams and Le Verrier
each their fair share of this great discovery, the
same impartial spirit is not to be found in France,
for nothing is more common, even in the present
day, in looking at French books of astronomy,
than to find Adams&rsquo;s name either glossed over or
absolutely suppressed altogether when the planet
Neptune is under discussion.</p>
<p>How remarkable a discovery this was, will
perhaps be realized, when it is stated that Adams
was only 2&frac12;&deg; out in assigning the position of the
new planet, whilst Le Verrier was even nearer,
being barely 1&deg; out.</p>
<p>We know practically nothing respecting the
physical appearance of Neptune, owing to its immense
distance from us, and for the like reason
the Neptunian astronomers, if there are any, will
know absolutely nothing about the Earth; indeed,
their knowledge of the Solar System will
be restricted to Uranus, Saturn, and the Sun.
Even the Sun will only have an apparent diameter
of about 1&prime; of arc, and, therefore, will only seem
to be a very bright star, yielding light equal in
amount, according to Z&ouml;llner, to about 700 full
moons. There is one satellite belonging to Neptune,
and as this has been calculated to exhibit a
disc 10&deg; in diameter, a certain amount of light
will no doubt be afforded by it especially if, as is
not unlikely, Neptune is itself possessed of some
inherent luminosity independently of the Sun.</p>
<p>The fact that Neptune seems destitute of visible
spots or belts, results in our being ignorant
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
of the period of its axial rotation, though it
should be stated that in 1883, Maxwell Hall in
Jamaica, observed periodical fluctuations in its
light, which he thought implied that the planet
rotated on its axis in rather less than 8 hours.
Several observers thought 20 or 30 years ago,
that they had noticed indications of Neptune
being surrounded by a ring like Saturn&rsquo;s ring,
but the evidence as to this is very inconclusive.
It is quite certain that none but the very largest
telescopes in the world would show any such
appendage, and this planet seems to have been
neglected of late years, by the possessors of such
telescopes. Moreover, if a ring existed it would
only open out to its full extent once in every 82
years, being the half of the period of the planet&rsquo;s
revolution round the Sun (just as Saturn&rsquo;s ring
only opens out to the fullest extent every 14&frac12;
years), so that, obviously, supposing suspicions
of a ring dating back 30 or 40 years were well
founded, it might well be that another 30 or 40
years might need to elapse, before astronomers
would be in a position to see their suspicions
revive.</p>
<p>Neptune revolves round the Sun in 164&frac12;
years, at a mean distance of 2791 millions of
miles. Its apparent diameter scarcely varies
from 2&frac34;&Prime;. Its true diameter is about 37,000
miles. No compression of the Poles is perceptible.
Its one satellite revolves round Neptune in
5&frac34; days, and in a retrograde direction, at a mean
distance of 223,000 miles, and shines as a star of
the 14th magnitude. This is a peculiarity which
it only shares with the satellites of Uranus, so far
as it regards the planetary members of the Solar
System, though there are many retrograde Comets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The question has often been mooted, whether
there exists, and belonging to the Solar System,
a planet farther off than Neptune. There does
seem some evidence of this, as we shall better
understand, when we come to the subject of long-period
Comets, though it cannot be said that much
progress has yet been made in arriving at a solution
of the problem.</p>
<p>Unless there does exist a trans-Neptunian
planet, a Neptunian astronomer will know very
little about planets, for Uranus and Saturn will
alone be visible to him. Both will of course be
what we call &ldquo;inferior planets,&rdquo; and under the
best of circumstances will cut a poor figure in the
Neptunian sky.</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">COMETS.</span></h2>
<p>I suppose that it is the experience of all those
who happen to be in any sense, however humble,
specialists in a certain branch of science, that
from time to time, they are beset with questions
on the part of their friends respecting those particular
matters which it is known that they have
specially studied. There is no fault to be found
with this thirst for information, always supposing
that it is kept within due bounds; but my motive
for alluding to it here, is to see whether any well-marked
conclusion can be drawn from it, within
my own knowledge as regards astronomical facts
or events. Now in the case of the science of
astronomy (for which in this connection I, for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
moment, will venture to speak), there is certainly
no one department which so unfailingly, at all
times and in all places, seems to evoke such popular
sympathy and interest as the department
which deals with Comets.</p>
<p>Sun-spots may come and go; bright planets
may shine more brightly; the Sun or Moon may
be obscured by eclipses; temporary stars may
burst forth,&mdash;all these things are within the ken
of the general public by means of newspapers or
almanacs, but it is a comet which evokes more
questionings and conversations than all the other
matters just referred to put together. When a
new and bright comet appears, or even when any
comet not very bright gets talked about, the old
question is still fresh and verdant&mdash;&ldquo;Is there any
danger to the Earth to be apprehended from collision
with a Comet?&rdquo; followed by &ldquo;What is a
Comet?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is it made of?&rdquo; &ldquo;Has it ever
appeared before?&rdquo; &ldquo;Will it come back again?&rdquo;
and so on. Questions in this strain have more
often than I can tell of been put to me. They
seem the stock questions of all who will condescend
to replace for five minutes in the day
the newest novel or the pending parliamentary
election.</p>
<p>It may be taken as a fact (though in no proper
sense a rule) that a bright and conspicuous comet
comes about once in 10 years, and a very remarkable
comet every 30 years. Thus we have had
during the present century bright comets in 1811,
1825, 1835, 1843, 1858, 1861, 1874 and 1882, whereof
those of 1811, 1843, and 1858 were specially celebrated.
Tested then by either standard of words
&ldquo;bright and conspicuous,&rdquo; or &ldquo;specially celebrated,&rdquo;
it may be affirmed that a good comet is
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
now due, so let us prepare for it by getting up the
subject in advance.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to answer in regular order
or in any set form the questions which I have
just mentioned as being stock questions, but they
will be answered in substance as we go along.
There is one matter in connection with comets
which has deeply impressed itself upon the public
mind, and that is the presence or absence of a
&ldquo;tail.&rdquo; It is not too much to say that the generality
of people regard the tail of a comet as <i>the</i>
comet; and that though an object may be a true
comet from an astronomer&rsquo;s point of view, yet if
it has no tail its claims go for nought with the
mass of mankind. We have here probably a
remnant of ancient thought, especially of that
line of thought which in bygone times associated
Comets universally with the idea that they were
especially sent to be portents of national disasters
of one kind or another. This is brought out by
numberless ancient authors, and by none more
forcibly than Shakespeare. Hence we have such
passages as the following in <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> (Act ii.,
sc. 2):&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When beggars die there are no comets seen,</p>
<p class="t0">The Heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In <i>Henry VI.</i> (Part I., Act i., sc. 1) we find the
well-known passage:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Comets importing change of times and states</p>
<p class="t0">Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</p>
<p class="t0">And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</p>
<p class="t0">That have consented unto Henry&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There are in point of fact two distinct ideas
evolved here: (1) that comets are prophetic of
evil, and (2) stars potential for evil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>There is another passage in <i>Henry VI</i>. (Part
I., Act iii., sc. 3) even more pronounced:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now shine it like a Comet of revenge,</p>
<p class="t0">A prophet to the fall of all our foes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Again; in <i>Hamlet</i> (Act i., sc. 1) we find:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,</p>
<p class="t0">Disasters in the Sun.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Once more; in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i> (Act
iii., sc. 2) we have the more general, but still emphatic
enough, idea expressed by the simple words
of reference to&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Some Comet or unusual prodigy.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Shakespeare may be said to have lived at the
epoch when astrology was in high favour, and it
may be that he only gave utterance to the current
opinion prevalent among all classes in those still
somewhat &ldquo;Dark Ages&rdquo; (so called). This, however,
can hardly be said of the author of my next
quotation&mdash;John Milton (<i>Paradise Lost</i>, bk. II.):&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t13">&ldquo;Satan stood</p>
<p class="t0">Unterrified, and like a Comet burned,</p>
<p class="t0">That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge</p>
<p class="t0">In th&rsquo; Arctic sky, and from its horrid hair</p>
<p class="t0">Shakes pestilence and war.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Jumping over a century we find the ancient
theory still in vogue, or Thomson (<i>Seasons</i>, Summer)
would never have written:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t8">&ldquo;Amid the radiant orbs</p>
<p class="t0">That more than deck, that animate the sky,</p>
<p class="t0">The life-infusing suns of other worlds;</p>
<p class="t0">Lo! from the dread immensity of space,</p>
<p class="t0">Returning with accelerated course,</p>
<p class="t0">The rushing comet to the sun descends;</p>
<p class="t0">And, as he sinks below the shading earth,</p>
<p class="t0">With awful train projected o&rsquo;er the heavens,</p>
<p class="t0">The guilty nations tremble.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Even Napoleon I. had servile flatterers who, as
late as 1808, tried to extract astrological influence
out of a comet by way of bolstering up &ldquo;Old
Bony.&rdquo; But enough of poetry and fiction, let us
hasten back to prosaic fact.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/fig19.jpg" alt="Fig. 19.&mdash;Telescope Comet with a nucleus." width="500" height="487" />
<p class="center"><span class="small"><span class="sc">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Telescope Comet with a nucleus.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Comets as objects to look at may be classed
under three forms, though the same comet may
undergo such changes as will at different epochs
in its career cause it to put on each variety of
form in succession. Thus the comet of 1825 seen
during that year as a brilliant naked-eye object,
after being lost in the sun&rsquo;s
rays, was again found on
April 2, 1826 by Pons.
Lamentable were his cries
at the miserable plight it
was in. He described it
as totally destroyed:
without tail, beard, coma
or nucleus, a mere spectre.
The simplest form of
comet is a mere nebulous
mass, almost always circular,
or perhaps a little
oval, in outline. It may maintain this appearance
throughout its visibility; or, growing brighter
may become a comet of the second class, with a
central condensation, which developing becomes
a &ldquo;nucleus&rdquo; or head. It may retain this feature
for the rest of its career, or may pass into the
third class and throw out a &ldquo;coma&rdquo; or beard,
which will perhaps develop into a tail or tails.
Doing this it will not unfrequently grow bright
enough and large enough to become visible to
the naked eye. In exceptional cases the nucleus
will become as bright as a 2nd or even 1st magnitude
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
star, and the tail may acquire a length of
several or many degrees. In the last named case
of all the comet becomes, <i>par excellence</i> according
to the popular sentiment, &ldquo;a comet.&rdquo; It will now
be readily inferred that the astronomer in his observatory
has to do with many comets which the
public at large never hear of, or if they do hear
of, treat with contempt, because they are destitute
of tails.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>The tails of comets exhibit very great varieties
not only of size but of form; some are long and
slender; some are long and much spread out
towards their ends, like quill pens, for instance;
some are short and stumpy, mere tufts or excrescences
rather than tails. Not unfrequently a tail
seems to consist of two parallel rays with no
cometary matter, or it may be only a very slight
amount of cometary matter traceable in the interspace;
some have one main tail consisting of
a pair of rays such as just described, together
with one or more subsidiary or off-shoot tails.
The comet of 1825 had five tails and the comet
of 1744 had six tails. It might be inferred from
all this that the tails of comets are so exceedingly
irregular, uncertain and casual as to be amenable
to no laws. This was long considered to be the
case; but a Russian observer named Bredichin,
as the result of much study and research, has
arrived at the conclusion that all comet tails may
be brought under one or other of three types;
and that each type is indicative of certain distinct
differences of origin and condition which he
considers himself able to define. The first type
comprises tails which are long and straight;
&ldquo;they are formed&rdquo; (to quote Young&rsquo;s statement
of Bredichin&rsquo;s views) &ldquo;of matter upon which the
Sun&rsquo;s repulsive action is from twelve to fifteen
times as great as the gravitational attraction, so
that the particles leave the comet with a relative
velocity of at least four or five miles a second;
and this velocity is continually increased as they
recede, until at last it becomes enormous, the
particles travelling several millions of miles in a
day. The straight rays which are seen in the
figure of the tail of Donati&rsquo;s Comet, tangential to
the tail, are streamers of this first type; as also
was the enormous tail of the comet of 1861.
The second type is the curved plume-like train,
like the principal tail of Donati&rsquo;s Comet. In this
type the repulsive force varies from 2.2 times
gravity (for the particles on the convex edge of
the tail) to half that amount for those which form
the inner edge. This is by far the most common
type of cometary train. A few comets show tails
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
of the third type&mdash;short, stubby, brushes violently
curved, and due to matter of which the repulsive
force is only a fraction of gravity&mdash;from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> to &frac12;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bredichin wishes it to be inferred that the
tails of the 1st type are probably composed of
hydrogen; those of the 2nd type of some hydro-carbon
gas; and those of the 3rd of the vapour
of iron, probably with some admixture of sodium
and other substances. Bredichin, as a reason for
these conclusions, supposes that the force which
generates the tails of comets is a repulsive force,
with a surface action the same for equal surfaces
of any kind of matter; the effective accelerating
force therefore measured by the velocity which
it would produce would depend upon the ratio
of surface to mass in the particles acted upon,
and so, in his view, should be inversely proportional
to their molecular weights. Now it happens
that the molecular weights of hydrogen, of
hydro-carbon gases, and of the vapour of iron
bear to each other just about the required proportion.</p>
<p>I am here stating the views and opinions of
others without definitely professing to be satisfied
with them, but as they have met with some
acceptance, it is proper to chronicle them, though
we know nothing of the nature of the repulsive
force here talked about. It might be electric, it
might be anything. The spectroscope certainly
lends some countenance to Bredichin&rsquo;s views, but
we need far more knowledge and study of comets
before we shall be justly entitled to dogmatise on
the subject.</p>

</div>
<p>This has been rather a digression. I go back
now to prosaic matters of fact, of which a vast
and interesting array present themselves for consideration
in connection with comets. Let us
consider a little in detail what they are, to look
at. We have seen that a well-developed comet
of the normal type usually comprises a nucleus,
a head or coma, and a tail. Comets which have
no tails generally exhibit heads of very simple
structure; and if there is a nucleus, the nucleus
is little else than a stellar point of light. But in
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
the case of the larger comets, which are almost
or quite visible to the naked eye, the head often
exhibits a very complex structure, which in not a
few cases seems to convey very definite indications
of the operations going on at the time.
Figs. 22 and 23 may be taken as samples of a
complex cometary head, though no two comets
resemble one another exactly in details. Fig. 24
forcibly conveys the idea that we are looking at
a process of development analogous to an uprush
of water from a fountain, or perhaps I might better
say, from a burst waterpipe. There is a distinct
idea of a jet. This self-same idea, in another
form, presents itself in the case of those comets
which exhibit what astronomers are in the habit
of calling &ldquo;luminous envelopes.&rdquo; The jet in this
case is not strictly a jet because it is not a continuous
outflow, or overflow, of matter; the idea
rather suggests itself of an intermittent overflow resulting
in accumulated layers, or strata, of matter
becoming visible. But with this we come to a
standstill; we cannot tell where the matter comes
from, and still less, where it goes to; we can only
record what our eyes, assisted by telescopes, tell
us. There can, however, I think, be no doubt
that the matter of a comet becomes displayed to
our senses as the result of a process of expulsion,
or repulsion, from the nucleus; and then, having
become launched into space, it comes under the
influence, also repulsive, of the Sun. All these
things are visible facts. As to causes, we suggest
little, because we know so little. Anyone who
has seen a comet and has watched the displays of
jets and luminous envelopes, such as I have endeavoured
to set forth, will realise at once how
impossible it is to describe these things in words.
They must be seen either in actual being or in
picture. Some further allusions to this branch of
the subject may perhaps be more advantageously
made after we have considered the movements
and orbits of comets.</p>

<p>There is often a slight general resemblance
between a planet and a comet, as regards the
path which each class of body pursues. Probably
the least reflective person likely to be following
me here understands the bare fact, that all the
planets revolve round the Sun, and are held to
defined orbits by the Sun&rsquo;s influence, or attraction,
as it is called. Perhaps, it is not equally
realised, that in a somewhat similar, but not quite
the same way, comets are influenced and controlled
by the Sun.</p>
<p>Comets must be considered as regards their
motions to be divisible into two classes:&mdash;(1)
Those which belong to the Solar System; and (2)
those which do not. Each of these two classes
must again be sub-divided, if we would really obtain
a just conception of how things stand.</p>
<p>By the Comets which belong to the Sun, I
mean those which revolve round the Sun in
closed orbits;<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a>
and are, or may be, seen again
and again at recurring intervals. There are 2
or 3 dozen comets which present themselves to
our gaze at stated intervals, varying from about
3 to 70 years. There are again other comets
which without any doubt (mathematically) are
revolving round the Sun in closed orbits, but in
orbits so large and with periods of revolution so
long (often many centuries), that though they
will return again to the sight of the inhabitants
of the earth some day, yet no second return having
been actually recorded, the astronomer&rsquo;s prediction
that they will return, remains at present
a prediction based on mathematics but nothing
more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>There is another class of Comet of which we
see examples from time to time, and having seen
them once shall never see again. This is because
these Comets move in orbits which are not
closed, and which are known as parabolic or hyperbolic
orbits respectively, because derived from
those sections of a cone which are called the
Parabola and the Hyperbola. It must be understood
that what I am now referring to is purely
a matter of orbit, and that no relationship subsists
between the size and physical features of a
Comet and the path it pursues in space. The
only sort of reservation, perhaps, to be made to
this statement is, that the comets celebrated for
their size and brilliancy, are often found to be
revolving in elliptic orbits of great eccentricity,
which means that their periods may amount to
many centuries.</p>
<p>It may be well to say something now as to
what is the ordinary career of a comet, so far as
visibility to us, the inhabitants of the Earth, is
concerned. Though this might be illustrated by
reference to the history of many comets, perhaps
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
there is no one more suitable for the purpose
than Donati&rsquo;s Comet of 1858. In former times,
when telescopes were few or non-existent, brilliant
comets often appeared very suddenly, just as
a carriage or a man does, as you turn the corner
of a street. Such things even happen still: for
instance, the great comet of 1861 burst upon us
all at once at a day&rsquo;s notice. Usually, however,
now in consequence of the large size of the telescopes
in use, and the great number of observers
who are incessantly on the watch, comets are
discovered when they are very small, because remote
both from the Earth and Sun, and many
weeks, or even months, it may be, before they
shine forth in their ultimate splendour. Now, let
us see how these statements are supported by the
history of Donati&rsquo;s comet in 1858. On June 2 in
that year, it was first seen by Donati at Florence,
as a faint nebulosity, slowly journeying northwards.
June passed away, and July, and August,
the comet all the while remaining invisible to the
naked eye; that is to say, it first became perceptible
to the naked eye on August 29, having put
forth a faint tail about August 20. After the
beginning of September its brilliancy rapidly
increased. On September 17, the head equalled
in brightness a 2nd magnitude star, the tail being
4&deg; long. Passing its point of nearest approach to
the Sun on September 29, it came nearest to the
Earth on October 10; though, perhaps, its appearance
a few days previously, namely on October
5, is the thing best remembered by those who
saw it, because it was on that night that the comet
passed over the 1st magnitude star Arcturus.
For several days about this time, the comet was
an object of striking beauty in the Western
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
Heavens, during the hours immediately after
sun-set. After October 10, it rapidly passed
away to the Southern hemisphere, diminishing
in brightness, as it did so, because receding from
the Earth and the Sun. It continued its career
through the winter; became invisible to the
naked eye; and finally invisible altogether in
March 1859. It remained in view, therefore, for
more than nine months, not to return again till
about the year 3158 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, for its period of revolution
was found to be about 2000 years.</p>
<p>I have been particular in sketching somewhat
fully the history of this comet so far as we are
concerned, because, as I have already said, it is
typical of the visible career of many comets.
Halley&rsquo;s comet in 1835 and 1836, went through
a somewhat similar series of changes. This
comet&mdash;a well-known periodical one of great
historic interest and brilliancy&mdash;may be commended
to the younger members of the rising
generation, because it is due to return again
to these parts of space a few years hence, or in
1910.</p>

</div>
<p>What is a comet made of? Men of Science
equally with the general public would like to be
able to answer this question, but they cannot do
so with satisfactory certainty. A great many
years ago Sir John Herschel wrote thus:&mdash;&ldquo;It
seems impossible to avoid the following conclusion,
that the matter of the nucleus of a comet is
powerfully excited and dilated into a vaporous
state by the action of the Sun&rsquo;s rays escaping in
streams and jets at those points of its surface
which oppose the least resistance, and in all probability
throwing that surface or the nucleus itself
into irregular motions by its reaction in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
act of so escaping, and thus altering its direction.&rdquo;
This passage was written of course before
the spectroscope had been brought to bear on the
observations of comets, but so far as Sir John
Herschel&rsquo;s remark implies the presence of vapour,
that is gas, in a comet, the surmise has
been amply borne out by later discoveries. The
fact that as a comet approaches the Sun some
forces, no doubt of solar origin, come into operation
to vaporise and therefore expand the matter
composing the comet is sufficiently shown by the
great developement which takes place as we have
seen in the tails of comets, but in regard to the
heads of comets we are face to face with a strange
enigma. Though the tails expand the heads contract
as the comet approaches its position of
greatest proximity to the Sun. Having passed
this point the head expands again. This curious
circumstance, first pointed out by Kepler in 1618,
has often been noticed since, and noticed indeed
not as the result of mere eye impressions, but
after careful micrometrical measurement with suitable
instruments. I think the confession must be
made that we are hopelessly ignorant of the nature
of comet&rsquo;s except that gases are largely concerned
in their constitution.</p>
<p>It seems impossible to doubt that some tails
of comets are hollow cylinders or hollow cones.
Such a theory would account for the fact, so
often noticed, that single tails are usually much
brighter at their two edges than at the centre.
This is the natural effect of looking transversely
at any translucent cylinder of measureable thickness.</p>
<p>It was long a moot point whether comets are
self-luminous, or whether they shine by reflected
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
light; but it is now generally admitted that whilst
a part of the light of a comet may be derived by
reflection from the Sun yet as a rule they must
be regarded as shining by their own intrinsic light.</p>
<p>It should be stated here by way of caution
that the observations on this subject are not so
consistent as one could wish, and it seems necessary
to assume that all comets are not constituted
alike, and that therefore what is true of one does
not necessarily apply to another.</p>
<p>To those who possess telescopes (not necessarily
large ones) opportunities for the study of
comets have much multiplied during the last few
years, for we are now acquainted with a group of
small comets which are constantly coming into
view at short intervals of time. The comets have
now become so numerous that seldom a year
passes without one or more of them coming into
view. Whilst that known as Encke&rsquo;s revolves
round the Sun in 3&frac14; years, Tuttle&rsquo;s doing the
same in 13&frac12; years, there are four others whose
periods average about 5&frac12; years, 5 which average
6&frac12; years, together with one of 7&frac12; years and one
of 8 years. It is thus evident that there is a constant
succession of these objects available for
study, and that very few months can ever elapse
that some one or more of them are not on view.
They bear the names of the astronomers who either
discovered them originally, or who, by studying
their orbits, discovered their periodicity. The
names run as follows, beginning with the shortest
in period and ending with the longest:&mdash;</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td>Encke&rsquo;s. </td><td>Winnecke&rsquo;s.</td></tr>

</table>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>I cannot stay to dwell upon either the history
or description of these comets separately, but
must content myself by saying generally that
whilst as a rule they are not visible to the naked
eye, yet several of them may occasionally become
so visible when they return to perihelion under
circumstances which bring them more near than
usual to the earth.</p>
<p>Several other comets are on record which it
was supposed at one time would certainly have
been entitled to a place in the above list, but
three of them in particular have, under very
mysterious circumstances, entirely disappeared
from the Heavens.</p>
<p>Chief amongst the mysterious comets must be
ranked that which goes by the name of Biela.
This comet, first seen in 1772, was afterwards
found to have a period of about 6&frac34; years, and on
numerous occasions it reappeared at intervals of
that length down to 1845, when the mysterious
part of its career seems to have commenced. In
December of that year this comet threw off a
fragment of nearly the same shape as itself, and
the two portions travelled together side by side
for four months, the distance between the fragments
slowly increasing. At the end of the four
months in question the comet passed out of sight
owing to the distance from the earth to which it
had attained. The comet returned again to perihelion
in 1852, remaining visible for three weeks.
The two portions of the comet noticed in 1846
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
retained their individuality in 1852, but the distance
between them had increased to about eight
times the greatest distance noticed in 1846. As
a comet Biela&rsquo;s Comet has never been seen since
1852, and it must now be regarded as having permanently
disappeared. But what seems to have
happened is this, that Biela&rsquo;s Comet has become
broken up into a mass of meteors. On November
27, 1872, and again in November 1885, when the
earth in travelling along its own orbit reached
a certain point where its orbit intersected the
former orbit of Biela&rsquo;s Comet the Earth encountered,
instead of the comet which ought to have
been there, a wonderful mass of meteors; and it
is now generally accepted that these meteors,
which apparently are keeping more or less together
as a fairly compact swarm, are nought else
than the disintegrated materials of what once was
Biela&rsquo;s Comet.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>It is extremely probable that as time goes on
we shall be able to say that an intimate connection
subsists between particular comets which
have been and particular meteoric swarms. We
already possess proof that other comets which
once came within our view were at that time revolving
round the Sun in orbits so comparatively
small that they should have reappeared at intervals
of half-a-dozen or so years, yet they have
not reappeared. The question therefore suggests
itself, Have they been subject to some great internal
disaster which has led to their disintegration?
It may be said without doubt that this is
in the highest degree probable; but short of this,
that is short of total disintegration into small
fragments, we have several cases on record of
what I may, for the moment, call ordinary comets
breaking up into two or three fragments. For a
long while astronomers were naturally loath to
believe that this was possible, and therefore they
discredited the statements to that effect which
had been made. Though it would occupy too
much space to give the particulars of these
comets in full it may yet be worth while just to
mention the names of some of them, presumed to
be of short period, which seemed nevertheless to
have eluded our grasp. I would here specially
mention Liais&rsquo;s Comet of 1860 and the second
comet of 1881 as seemingly having undergone
some sort of disruption akin to what happened in
the case of Biela&rsquo;s Comet.</p>
<p>There is another group of periodical comets
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
to be mentioned. These are six in number and
seem to have periods of 70 years or a little more.
Of these three have not yet given us the chance
of seeing them again; two have paid us a second
visit, and therefore their periods are not open
to doubt; whilst the most famous of this group,
&ldquo;Halley&rsquo;s,&rdquo; has been recorded to have shown
itself to the Earth no less than 25 times, beginning
with the year 11 <span class="small">B. C.</span> It was Halley&rsquo;s
comet which shone over Europe in April 1066,
and was considered the forerunner of the conquest
of England by William of Normandy. It
figures in the famous Bayeux tapestry as a hairy
star of strange shape.</p>
<p>It would seem that there exists in some inscrutable
manner a connection between each of
the three great exterior planets and certain
groups of comets. In the case of Jupiter the
association is so very pronounced as long ago to
have attracted notice; but the French astronomer,
Flammarion, has brought forward some
suggestions that Saturn has one comet (and perhaps
two) with which it is associated; Uranus,
two (and perhaps three); and Neptune, six;
whilst farther off than Neptune the fact that
there are two comets, supposed periodical, without
a known planet to run with them has inspired
Flammarion to look with a friendly eye on the
idea (often mooted) that outside of Neptune
there exists another undiscovered planet revolving
round the sun in a period of about 300 years.</p>
<p>The Jupiter group of comets deserves a few
additional words. There are certainly nine, and
perhaps twelve comets revolving round the Sun
in orbits of such dimensions that they either
reach up to or slightly overreach the orbit of
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
Jupiter. The effect of this condition of things is
that on occasions Jupiter and each of the comets
may come into such proximity that the superior
mass of Jupiter may exercise a very seriously
disturbing influence over a flimsy and ethereal
body like a comet. There is reason to suppose
that some of the comets now belonging to the
Jupiter group have not done so for any great
length of time, but having been wandering about,
either in elliptic orbits of great extent, or even in
parabolic orbits, have accidentally come within
reach of Jupiter, and so have been, as it were,
captured by him. Hence, the origin of the term,
the &ldquo;capture theory,&rdquo; as applied to these family
groups of comets which I have just stated to
exist, each presided over, as it were, by a great
planet. It may be that at some future time this
theory will help us to a clue to the fact that besides
the comets of Lexell of 1770, Blainpain of
1819, and Di Vico of 1844, short period comets
unaccountably missing, there are several others
presumed to have been revolving in short period
orbits when discovered, and as to which it is very
strange that they should not have been seen before
their only recorded visit to us, and equally strange
that they should never have been seen since.</p>
<p>Is there any reason to fear the results of a
collision between a comet and the Earth? None
whatever. However vague may be, and in a certain
sense must be, our answer to the question,
&ldquo;What is a comet?&rdquo; certain is it that every
comet is a very imponderable body&mdash;a sort of
airy nothing, a mass of gas or vapour.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
At the
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
same time it always has been and perhaps still is
difficult to persuade the public that whatever
might be the effect on a comet if it were to strike
the Earth, the effect on the Earth, were it to be
struck by a comet, would be <i>nil</i>. This is not
altogether a matter of speculation, for according
to a calculation by Hind, on June 30, 1861, the
Earth passed into and through the tail of the
great comet of that year at about two-thirds of
its distance from the nucleus. Assuredly there
was no dynamical result; but it seems, however,
not unlikely that there was an optical result; at
any rate, traces of something of this sort were
noted. Hind himself, in Middlesex, observed a
peculiar phosphorescence or illumination of the
sky which he attributed at the time to an auroral
glare. Lowe, in Nottinghamshire confirmed
Hind&rsquo;s statement of the appearance of the heavens
on the same day. The sky had a yellow
auroral glare-like look, and the Sun, though shining,
gave but feeble light. The comet was plainly
visible at 7.45 p. m. (during sunshine), and had a
much more hazy appearance than on any subsequent
evening. Lowe adds that his Vicar had
the pulpit candles lighted in the Parish Church
at 7 o&rsquo;clock (it was a Sunday), though only five
days had elapsed since Midsummer day, which
itself proves that some sensation of darkness was
felt even while the Sun was shining.</p>
<p>So far as I remember there has been no such
thing as a comet panic during the present generation,
at any rate in civilised countries, but it is
on record that there was a very considerable
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
panic in 1832 in connection with the return of
Biela&rsquo;s Comet in the winter of that year. Olbers
as the result of a careful study in advance of the
comet&rsquo;s movements found that the comet&rsquo;s centre
would pass only 20,000 miles within the Earth&rsquo;s
orbit, and that as the nebulosity of the comet
had in 1805 been more than 20,000 miles in diameter,
it was certain, unless its dimensions had
diminished in the 27 years, that some of the
comet&rsquo;s matter would overlap the Earth&rsquo;s orbit;
in other words would envelop the Earth itself, if
the Earth happened to be there. This conclusion
when it became public was quite enough to create
a panic and make people talk about the forthcoming
destruction of our globe. It was nothing
to the point (in the public mind) that astronomers
were able to predict that the Earth would not
reach the place where the comet would cross the
Earth&rsquo;s orbit until four weeks after the comet
had come and gone. However, we now know
that nothing happened, and I am justified in
adding that even if there had been contact, Earth
meeting comet face to face, nothing (serious)
would have occurred so far as the Earth was
concerned.</p>
<p>This seems a convenient place for referring to
a matter which when it was first broached excited
a great deal of interest, but about which one does
not hear much now-a-days. The period of the
small comet known as Encke&rsquo;s (which, revolving
as it does round the Sun in a little more than
three years, has the shortest period of any of the
periodical comets) was found many years ago to
be diminishing at each successive return. That
is to say, it always attained its nearest distance
from the Sun at each apparition 2&frac12; hours sooner
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
than it ought to have done. In order to account
for this gradual diminution in the comet&rsquo;s period
Encke conjectured the existence of a thin ethereal
medium sufficiently dense to affect a light flimsy
body like a comet, but incapable of obstructing a
planet. It has been remarked by Hind that &ldquo;this
contraction of the orbit must be continually progressing,
if we suppose the existence of such a
medium; and we are naturally led to inquire,
What will be the final consequence of this resistance?
Though the catastrophe may be averted
for many ages by the powerful attraction of the
larger planets, especially Jupiter, will not the
comet be at last precipitated on the Sun? The
question is full of interest, though altogether
open to conjecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Astronomers are not altogether agreed as to
the propriety of this explanation. One argument
against it is that with <i>perhaps</i> one exception none
of the other short-period comets (all of them
small and presumably deficient in density) seem
affected as Encke&rsquo;s is. On the other hand Sir
John Herschel favoured the explanation just
given, as also does Hind who is the highest living
authority on comets. A German mathematician,
Von Asten, who devoted immense labour to the
study of the orbit of Encke&rsquo;s Comet, thought
there should be no hesitation in accepting the
idea of a resisting medium, subject to the limitation
that it does not extend beyond the orbit
of Mercury. Von Asten&rsquo;s allusion to Mercury
touches a subject which belongs more directly to
the question of Mercury&rsquo;s orbit and to that other
very interesting question, &ldquo;Are there any planets,
not at present known, revolving round the Sun
within the orbit of Mercury.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Which is the largest and most magnificent
comet recorded in history? It is virtually impossible
to answer this question, because of the extravagant
and inflated language made use of by
ancient and medieval (I had almost added, and
modern) writers. There is no doubt that the
comet of 1680, studied by Sir I. Newton, the tail
of which was curved, and from 70&deg; to 90&deg; long,
must have been one of the finest on record, as it
was also the one which came nearest to the Sun,
for it almost grazed the Sun&rsquo;s surface.</p>
<p>The comet of 1744, visible as it was in broad
daylight, was, no doubt, the finest comet of the
18th century, though in size it has been surpassed;
yet its six tails must have made it a most remarkable
object. So far as the 19th century is concerned,
our choice lies between the comets of
1811, 1843, 1858, and 1861. The comet of 1811
is spoken of by Hind as &ldquo;perhaps the most famous
of modern times. Independently of its great
magnitude, the position of the orbit and epoch of
perihelion passage, were such as to render it a
very splendid circumpolar object for some
months.&rdquo; The tail as regards its length was not
so very remarkable, for at its best, in October
1811, it was only about 25&deg; long, its breadth, however,
was very considerable; at one time 6&deg;, the
real length of the tail, about the middle of October,
was more than 100,000,000 of miles, and its
breadth about 15,000,000 of miles. The visibility
of this comet was coincident with those events
which proved to be the turning-point in the career
of Napoleon I., and there were not wanting those
who regarded the comet as a presage of his disastrous
failure in Russia. Owing to the long period
(17 months), during which this comet was visible,
it was possible to determine its orbit with unusual
precision. Argelander found its period to be 3065
years, with no greater uncertainty than 43 years.
The great dimensions of its orbit will be realised
when it is stated that this comet recedes from the
Sun to a distance of 14 times that of the planet
Neptune.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>Donati&rsquo;s comet of 1858, has already received
a good deal of notice at my hands, but the question
remains, what are its claims, to be regarded
as the comet of the century, compared with that
of 1843? It is not a little strange that though
there must have been many persons who saw both,
yet it was only quite recently that I came across,
for the first time, a description of both these
comets from the same pen. It ought, however,
to be mentioned by way of explanation, that the
inhabitants of Europe only saw the comet of 1843,
when its brilliancy and the extent of its tail had
materially diminished, about a fortnight after it
was at its best.</p>
<p>The description of these two comets to which
I have alluded, will be found in General J. A.
Ewart&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>Story of a Soldier&rsquo;s Life</i>,&rdquo; published in
1881. Writing first of all of the comet of 1843,
General Ewart says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was during our passage from the Cape of
Good Hope to the Equator, and when not far from
St. Helena, that we first came in sight of the great
comet of 1843. In the first instance a small portion
of the tail only was visible, at right angles to the
horizon; but night after night as we sailed along,
it gradually became larger and larger, till at last
up came the head, or nucleus, as I ought properly
to call it. It was a grand and wonderful sight,
for the comet now extended the extraordinary
distance of one-third of the heavens, the nucleus
being, perhaps, about the size of the planet
Venus.&rdquo;&mdash;(Vol. i., p. 75.)</p>

<p>As regards Donati&rsquo;s comet of 1858, what the
General says is:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very large comet made its appearance
about this time, and continued for several weeks
to be a magnificent object at night; it was, however,
<i>nothing to the one I had seen in the year 1843</i>,
when on the other side of the equator.&rdquo;&mdash;(Vol. ii., p. 205.)</p>
<p>Passing over the great comet of 1861, on which
I have already said a good deal, I must quit the
subject of famous comets by a few words about
that of 1882, which, though by no means one of
the largest, was, in some respects, one of the most
remarkable of modern times. It was visible for
the long period of nine months, and was conspicuously
prominent to the naked eye during
September, but these facts, though note-worthy,
would not have called for particular remark, had
not the comet exhibited some special peculiarities
which distinguished it from all others. In the
first place, it seems to have undergone certain
disruptive changes, in virtue of which the nucleus
became split up into four independent nuclei.
Then the tail may have been tubular, its extremity
being not only bifid, but totally unsymmetrical
with respect to the main part. The tubular
character of the tail was suggested by Tempel.
To other observers, this feature gave the idea of
the comet, properly so-called, being enclosed in a
cylindrical envelope, which completely surrounded
the comet, and overlapped it for a considerable
distance at both ends. Finally (and in this resembling
Biela&rsquo;s comet) the comet of 1882 seems
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
to have thrown off a fragment which became an
independent body.</p>
<p>What has gone before, will, I think, have
served abundantly to establish the position with
which I started, namely, that comets occupy (and
deservedly so) the front rank amongst those
astronomical objects in which, on occasions, the
general public takes an interest.</p>
<p class="tb">I have thus completed, so far as the space at
my disposal has permitted, a popular descriptive
Survey of the Solar System. Those who have
perused the preceding pages, however slight may
have been their previous acquaintance with the
Science of Astronomy taken as a whole, will have
no difficulty in realising that what I have said
bears but a small proportion to what I have left
unsaid. They will equally, I hope, be able to see,
without indeed the necessity of a suggestion, that
all those wondrous orbs which we call the planets
could neither have come into existence nor have
been maintained in their allotted places for so
many thousands of years, except as the result of
Design emanating from an All-powerful Creator.</p>
